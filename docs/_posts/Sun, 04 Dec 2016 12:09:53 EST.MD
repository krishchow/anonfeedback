[quote]Don't you think a little percentage of the total mark for the assignment should be given just for trying to do the assignment? I mean for students who are new to Python, it is extremely difficult to receive a good mark in the assignments. If just 5% or 10% marks were awarded for attempting, it would be really nice for everyone. Because otherwise, what is the difference between someone who doesn't even try to do the assignment and someone who does it but still gets a 0? Ultimately both of them get a zero only and so students who get a zero would not even try to do it the next time. I mean it will be really helpful if you award partial marks if other parts of the code are correct and according to the function design recipe except the body. [/quote]

<p>\n\nSorry, no. We're not evaluating effort. We're evaluating whether or not a student is able to demonstrate an outcome. \n\nWhy? In CSC148, the instructor is going to expect that you are able to demonstrate the desired outcomes of CSC108: that you can read a description of a problem (with definitions) and translate it into working code or an effective set of tests. If someone tries hard but is unable to perform those tasks, they are not ready for 148.</p>
