[quote]The assignment is very VERY VERY VERY poorly worded. It is impossible to understand what is being asked of us. Many of the things being asked for are not defined. What is BlOCK_SIZE. The only time this was mentioned was when were asked to do something with it.

<p>\nI cant increment and integer i if I didn&#x27;t declare it earlier in my code now can I? Please explain better......[/quote]\n\nWhile I hear that you're frustrated, you haven't made a good case. In particular, I don't think this example is a good one: BLOCK_SIZE is defined in the handout.\n\n[code] The first argument is required and should be an integer representing the "block size": the number of bytes that the computed hash should be. ...\n  Usage:\n      compute_hash BLOCK_SIZE [ COMPARISON_HASH ][/code]\n\nIf you're referring to [i]block_size[/i] (no caps), it's defined in the starter code, and it's mentioned in "tt" text to tell you that it's a variable.</p>
