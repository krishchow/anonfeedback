[quote]Since we are re-using A2 code for A3, can you provide solutions to give everyone an even playing field for the next assignment? I know that is asking a lot but if that's not feasible, maybe a discussion board post which will go into detail about how people who struggled can complete the assignment instead? I really don't want to struggle in A3 because my A2 is incorrect. [/quote]

<p>\n\nNo, I won't provide A2 solutions. Being gifted a solution won't help in the long term; it may not even help with A3, since you'll need to understand how it works and will need to modify your A2 significantly to make it work for A3. \n\nUltimately: I want you to be able to write recursive solutions to problems and to be comfortable walking a file tree. If it takes some extra time -- and some visits to office hours -- that's okay. In fact, that's [i]great[/i]. I'll be around much of reading week (and the week after), and I'll be holding office hours as normal.</p>
