[quote]While we extremely appreciate your generosity in terms of extending a2. Some students have, the STA260 and 209 midterm on the same day. Is there a possibility of moving the midterm to another day OR have the stats students do the midterm another day? [/quote]

<p>\n\nThe midterm date has been advertised since the first day of classes and is part of the marking scheme so, no, I cannot (easily) move it. \n\nI will be scheduling a midterm make-up on Friday, March 9, primarily for students who are ill on the midterm date or who have a conflict with a secheduled course. If you have a conflict, then please mail me, so that I know to accommodate you on Friday. If you're in STA260 and want to talk about taking the midterm on Friday, then, similarly, mail me. (And yes, it'll be a different midterm paper ...)</p>
