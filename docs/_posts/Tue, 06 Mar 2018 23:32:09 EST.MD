[quote]The wording for question 4c and 4d on the midterm was quite unclear in my opinion. One of the TA's told me that "location" referred to the location of the node which makes it a pointer. However, one of the profs told me that it is the location of the pointer which makes it a pointer to a pointer. Can you please accept both implementations for those two parts. [/quote]

<p>\n\nWe're marking it tomorrow. My inclination -- without having started marking -- is that the second interpretation you listed is the more correct one. If a pointer to an already-allocated node were passed into the function, then how would you represent an empty list? Our assignment implementation used a double pointer for that reason. In any case, it is, at most, a point.</p>
