[quote]The marking scheme for the midterm was a bit harsh [/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nWe tried to soften it a bit by removing marks (Q1A, Q3A) when we thought we were marking concepts that were not covered well in lectures. However, in general, we drew a pretty hard line when it came to (1) getting types correct and (2) understanding the expected output of code. I expect we'll draw a similar bold line on the exam, mostly because I think those are important things to get right and partly because it's difficult for the TAs to provide partial marks consistently when there are so many ways to get a question wrong.</p>
