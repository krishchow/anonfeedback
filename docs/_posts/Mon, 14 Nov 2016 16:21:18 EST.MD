[quote]Today in lecture, you mentioned that the assignment 2 postings on the discussion board was a mess so I have a few suggestions that can help with assignment 3 postings. 
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\n1 - You can create another subgroup in the Assignment #___ sub-forum for each specific function rather than having to go through page by page searching or not being able to find the answer in search.\n\n2 - I think there&#x27;s a method on myBB forum that allows you to do this, you can mark down (either putting some type of symbol or indicator or by putting a tag in front of the title) which genera/common/typical questions are [ANSWERED] so students don&#x27;t have to go on a &#x27;Thread-Jumping Adventure&#x27; attempting to find the answer.\n\n3 - If students have specific questions relating to them only (or others eventually) that is different than the general/common/typical questions, they can still post it, however if the question is replicated, you can delete it.\n\n4 - Have students put some indicator tag at the beginning of the title based on their question.\nie. [ERROR], [OUTPUT], [QUESTION], [CLARIFICATION], [COMMENT], [ADVICE] etc.\n\nHope that helps \nI prefer to remain anonymous for this but if you would like to discuss more or require assistance, ill be happy to identify myself.[/quote]\n\nThank you, anonymous. Your comments were very helpful, and while we didn't implement several of the suggestions, the reasons were primarily technical. (Our ability to add indicators to myBB is limited, for example.)</p>
