[quote]Why are we taught to use wq to write and quit vi when it's faster to just use ZZ?[/quote]\n\nI generally prefer to memorize as few things as possible, and I generally prefer to use things that are easier to memorize because they "make sense."\n\nIf you learn "ZZ", then you've memorized a single shortcut for saving and exiting, and since "ZZ" doesn't mean anything, it takes effort (for me) to memorize it. \n\nOn the other hand, if you learn ":wq", then you're picking up (hopefully, once you see a few other examples) three things that might be relevant in other contexts. First, ":" is used to introduce commands. Many other commands will require you to start with a ":". Second, "w" stands for "write." It makes sense, like "a" standing for "append" and "i" standing for "insert". (Admittedly, "o" for "open a new line" is a stretch.) Third, "q" stands for "quit".\n\nSo, if you eventually want to quit without saving, it's better to have learned "q" than "ZZ". If you want to save without quitting, it's good that you know about "w".\n\nIf you're really concerned about one keystroke, though, then pick up ":x" (for exit).
