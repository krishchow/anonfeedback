[quote]Hey I realized that https://pcrs.teach.cs.toronto.edu/ seems to have an option for CSC258 that is shared by all campuses but we can't access it. Is PCRS for CSC258 in development? I look forward to learn CSC258 through the help of another resource.\n\nAlso, does other CSC258 lectures in the future/ in St George also depend on the DDCA textbook?[/quote]\n\nWe used PCRS to host videos students created that were related to CSC258 material. Some of those videos are useful, some are funny, and some contain incorrect info ... so I didn't link them this year.  \n\nI can't say what textbook will be used in the future at UTM, but StG currently uses [url=http://go.utlib.ca/cat/4564084]Hamacher et al's Computer Organization[/url]. I personally don't like that text; it covers lots of architecture but very little digital design, which is a significant part of the course. My absolute favorite digital design book is [url=http://go.utlib.ca/cat/5056512]Mano and Kime's Logic and Computer Design Fundamentals[/url]. We don't use it, though, because it's light on architecture (though it does have some) and because the students in 2011-12 found it even more difficult to read.
