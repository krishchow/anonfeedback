[quote]I don't think it is fair that you had bonus on exam. Just grade less strictly. You should not give student extra point if they get all of the details in memory question.[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThe details are important in these questions, but there are a [i]lot[/i] of details, and I don't want to penalize someone for just omitting a detail when they are in a stressful situation. For example, in the question that had a for loop, how many people remembered that the [i]int i[/i] loop variable in the for loop needed space? \n\n[i]I[/i] forgot that when I first created the question. It's not that I wouldn't know where it should go; I just skipped over it when I was drawing the diagram. So we added a couple extra points on that question, so you can omit (forget) one or two things and still do okay.</p>
