[quote]I just started using the code editor on the PCRS, and it's super useful for doing exams, trying out little snippets of code etc. It's just like the python shell where you can try out simple concepts. I know the PCRS talked aobut it a little at the start, but I wish it had been advertised in lectures etc earlier on.[/quote]
