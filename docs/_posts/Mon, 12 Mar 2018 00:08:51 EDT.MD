[quote]Since this is like a Reddit AMA. What is the worst behavior you have ever gotten from a student?\nAlso are there any students that have graduated that have made you proud of their work?\nPs. Sorry for any unpleasant memories.[/quote]\n\nMost of the worst behaviour I've witnessed has been related to academic offenses. There's a bunch of unpleasant stuff there. The most egregious, I think, was a student who stole his roommate's homework and sold it. He denied it until he was finally confronted by the people he sold the work to. He was completely at peace with his roommate taking the blame.\n\nI'm happy to still be in regular contact with a dozen former students (and sporadically in contact with a few more), and I'm just generally proud of what they've done for themselves. In particular, there's a guy who finished his CISSP, another who built a security team at a bank, one who is now a fellow at Cambridge, and a couple who have successfully spun up startups.
