[quote]In the future with adding labs to our repos could you try to not do it while we are trying to submit an assignment, because the changes I made didn't stick when there was a non-fastforward. even after I merged it [/quote]

<p>\n\nSorry, but no, I can't do that. \n\n1) There's basically no time, except for the very beginning and end of the course, when there isn't someone in the class who isn't currently submitting something (an assignment, a lab, whatever).  \n\n2) The whole reason for using [i]git[/i] is that it's version control. It should never lose your files. Even if a [i]push[/i] to the remote fails, your local [i]commit[/i] will not have failed -- so your files are safely in your local repository.</p>
