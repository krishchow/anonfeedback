[quote]Wait do we all get a 20% penalty for remarks? I thought you said it was only for people whose code failed to compile?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIf we [i]remark[/i] your code because our tests failed to mark your code correctly, there isn't a penalty. If we are marking a [i]resubmission[/i] because your code couldn't be tested, then there's a penalty. If we have to modify your code, it's probably a resubmission.</p>
