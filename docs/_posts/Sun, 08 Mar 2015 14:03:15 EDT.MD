[quote=Anonymous]One lab should be independent of all other labs.[/quote]\n\nIf necessary, you can use components from the Quartus standard library. They already have muxes of various sizes, for example.\n\nThat being said: the labs build on each other because the course also builds from week to week. If you're unable to complete a lab one week, it's worth spending some time to finish it up to make sure you understand the content from that week.\n\nAddendum: I received an update on this feedback which asked me to consider removing the deadline on labs and awarding marks for all labs completed by the end of the term. Unfortunately, that's just not something I think would be useful. Staying "current" with the class is very important because the content builds on itself from week to week. I think there's value in providing incentive in remaining current.
