[quote]The instructions for A1 were unclear.[/quote]\n\n[quote]This is assignment is impossible. Not that it is hard, but the instructions aren't very clear. I have no idea what I'm doing, or if I am doing it correctly.[/quote]\n\nI appreciate that you're sending feedback, but feedback like this isn't helpful, in the sense that it won't change anything I do. Effective feedback is (a) precise and (b) actionable. While your message tells me that you're not happy, I can't, based on this feedback, act on it. And without specific examples, all I can say is, "I disagree ... ?"\n\nTo put it another way: If I thought it were unclear, I would have fixed it. So, please give me a bit more: can you quote something that you had trouble understanding? What did you think it meant?
