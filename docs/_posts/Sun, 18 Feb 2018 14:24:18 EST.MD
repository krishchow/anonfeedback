[quote]I have multiple "file does not exist" type of fails for my program,\nI used lstat and checked if the return value was 0, if it wasn't then I returned 1 as the file doesn't exist.\n\nHow was it supposed to be done since this method didn't work, and out of curiosity could we get the tests? (I tried creating my own where the files don't exist and I got the correct return values)[/quote]\n\nYou've just asked, "How could I have fixed my code" while you're anonymous. That totally doesn't work. \n\nThe method you've described sounds right, so the error could be in (1) the exact use of lstat, (2) the tree that is generated, (3) the return value being passed recursively, ... This has to be a conversation where I know who you are, so I can see your code.
