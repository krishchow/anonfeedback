<p>\nWhat about student volunteers :cool:\n[/quote]\n\n... maybe. I don't generally work with volunteers for two reasons.\n\nFirst, I'm generally opposed to students doing uncompensated work. There are circumstances where it's probably worth your time. Being an MCSS exec, for example, is voluntary labour, but the line on a CV is probably worth it. Getting involved in an active open source project, where you can interact with other professionals, is probably also valuable. Doing novel or particularly challenging PCRS development, where I could justify making it an independent study (so you get course credit) also fits. But if you're doing maintenance on PCRS, I feel like you need to be paid.\n\nSecond, volunteers tend to be flaky. If you're doing something for fun -- not as a job -- then it's easy to walk away or to take a couple days to do something else. I think that's to be expected, and I wouldn't blame a student for walking away from a volunteer project ... but getting a new developer is expensive, in terms of time, for me. The first few weeks of work are not, generally, valuable, so for it to be worthwhile to me, I need a commitment.</p>
