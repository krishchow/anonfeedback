[quote]Why is CSC290 a SCI course? If it about communication, would it not be better if it was a HUM or SOC course? It would really help with those annoying breadth requirements. [/quote]

<p>\n\nIt's not a humanities course or a social sciences course just because it contains some writing! The humanities study human culture, and the social sciences investigate relationships and phenomenon within society. CSC290 contains neither; it's a technical writing course focused on CS documents.</p>
