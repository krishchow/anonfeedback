[quote]Are we done with the hardware part for this course? Will we be starting assembly next week? Where are we right now?[/quote]\n\nNo, we're in the middle. In lecture, we'll be looking at how a single cycle processor works, using devices that you've built (and that you composed into a simple processor in lab last week).  In lab, you'll use an HDL for a week, just to get a sense of how hardware is built now. After that, we'll transition into programming that devic -- and that's a transition into software.
