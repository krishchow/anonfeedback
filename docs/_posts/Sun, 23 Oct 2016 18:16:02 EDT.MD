[quote]thoughts on the midterm
<!-- more -->
<p>\n1 - Woah, it was disorganized at the end (in room IB110), students got up without the all the tests being collected, I don&#x27;t think that was supposed to happen?\n2 - some of the questions were easy to make little mistakes on, sure I made some bad ones\n3 - have a good weekend[/quote]\n\nYeah, in general, if you're at a test at the end and tests are being collected, everyone in the room should refrain from talking and stay seated until all tests are picked up. In the exam, the invigilators could get riled up if there is talking or moving during that phase of the exam, so be careful: don't get an academic offense for standing up at the exam!</p>
