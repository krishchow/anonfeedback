[quote]With all due respect, the department website says that Dr. Dan Zingaro is in charge of sessional hiring for CS at UTM. Why do you keep on saying that you are busy hiring staff for next year CS courses?[/quote]

<p>\n\nYou're either questioning whether I know the job I'm doing or insinuating that I'm lying. Either is insulting. Please lay off.\n\nProf. Zingaro had a conflict of interest in the last round of sessional hiring, so I ended up doing it. Beyond that, we have to hire [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=7467&pid=27931#pid27931]faculty, as well[/url], and that's most of the hiring work that I'm involved with this term.</p>
