[quote]Whats the average of the course going into the exam, now that all the marks are released? [/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI hesitate to say, because it'll lead people to speculate about the difficulty of the exam and the inference that "term marks are [low/high] so the exam will be [easy/hard]" isn't a good one, in my opinion. Please keep in mind that I don't write exams to create a set marks distribution and that, even if I were to do so, I didn't have term mark info when I wrote the exam.\n\nIn any case, both the median and mean are about 74%.</p>
