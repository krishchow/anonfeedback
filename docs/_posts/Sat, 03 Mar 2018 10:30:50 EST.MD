[quote]Any hints for the midterm?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nWatch your time. Each point should be allocated a certain number of minutes. Last year, we had 15 points, so there were roughly 3 minutes per point. If some points go quickly, you can use the extra time elsewhere, but don't spend all of your time on the first couple points.  \n\nDon't rush the first page. It often has easy but picky things on it, and it's easy to lose those marks.\n\nReview the labs and assignments. \n\nDon't focus on C syntax. That's not the point.</p>
