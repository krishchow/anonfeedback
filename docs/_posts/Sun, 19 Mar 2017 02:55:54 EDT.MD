[quote]What is the google analytics on the course website for? And I guess this is not really anonymous is it?[/quote]\n\nI've occasionally used Google analytics to see when and how frequently people access specific course pages -- like assignments and labs. It's info for making decisions like "should this assignment deadline be extended?"\n\nTheoretically, if I had enough info about you, I could de-anonymize anonymous feedback. In particular, I'd need a mapping between your name and the IPs you tend to use. (Whenever you interact with a server, your info gets logged. For example, if I were the sys admin, I could figure out your IP from the web access logs. Then, if you used git from the same IP, I would be able to associate your user ID with your IP ... and then I could see what feedback you sent.) However, I'm not a sys admin on the system that hosts anon feedback, so I don't have access to the server logs, so it would be relatively difficult to figure out who you are.
