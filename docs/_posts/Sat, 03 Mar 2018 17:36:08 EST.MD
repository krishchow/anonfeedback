[quote]A small update on the group chat poll asking us whether we understand 258 so far:
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nno: 2\nmostly no: 12\ninbetween: 3\nof course ez pz + mostly yes: 9[/quote]\n\nThanks for the info. Those of you in the "no" or "mostly no" category: please don't just hope that you'll be able to cram right before the exam. It'll take work and time to get caught up.\n\nOne concrete thing you could do is to start working through past evaluations to generate a list of questions/areas of confusion that you can work on. There are practice midterms posted, and the quizzes for each week are also up. As you work through these, bring them into office hours or post on the discussion board to get answers to your questions.</p>
