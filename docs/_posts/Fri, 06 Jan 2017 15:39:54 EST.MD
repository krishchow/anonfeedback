[quote]Could you please supply the recommended readings from the textbook for each week?[/quote]\n\nSure. I can post some reference readings. However, at the beginning of the term, there will be a [i]lot[/i] of reading, and I don't intend for you to actually read it all cover to cover. (For example, we are covering material from Chapters 1 to 9 -- over 150 pages -- in the first week.) The textbook is for reference: when you are working on a problem and need more info or are having problem with a bit of syntax, it's a reference to skim. Much of it will be familiar from prior courses.
