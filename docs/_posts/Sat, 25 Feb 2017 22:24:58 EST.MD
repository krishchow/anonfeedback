[quote]for anonymous feedback, are we allowed to ask questions not relevant to the course? as in, will you be annoyed if you're constantly getting off topic questions?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIt's called "... feedback", and that's my intention when providing it: it's a channel for telling me what you think about the course. Sometimes, questions are feedback (like when someone asks for an extension), but in general, I value thoughts about the course more than questions.\n\nI generally don't answer questions about content anonymously. It's more productive for you (and me) if you engage in a conversation about the topic, rather than asking a one-shot question. Also, asking questions anonymously suggests that asking questions is somehow shameful, and I hope that's not the case.\n\nI'm generally pretty happy to answer off-topic questions . Sometimes, people want to know about why I'm teaching the way I am -- or what I think about something -- and I can understand that it might not be comfortable to ask me these questions non-anonymously. If I think a question is completely unrelated, I'll probably just ignore it (like the question asking me when I sleep).</p>
