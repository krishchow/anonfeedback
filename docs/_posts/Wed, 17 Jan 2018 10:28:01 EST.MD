[quote]Can we attend other labs to get help?[/quote]

<p>\n\nFor now, I'd prefer that you not. \n\nFirst, there's a quiz at the beginning, and that's a testing situation. You really can't be in the room for that.  \n\nSecond, the students in the lab need help, too, and if you're there, you're taking time from them. Once the semester settles down a bit, it might be possible to create some open lab hours, but for now, the TAs have their hands full with the people enrolled in their lab.</p>
