[quote]Hi Andrew

<p>\n\nI know you said you don't want to extend the assignment into the break but could we an extension till Saturday or Sunday. The last two weeks have been busy with tests. I understand that you might by be thinking that by now, we should already be accustomed to the schedule that comes with this program but it's not always easy.\n\nI just wanted to try and appeal to you to consider it.\n\nThank you.[/quote]\n\nI agree. This program -- and being a student -- isn't easy, and I understand that this is a busy time in the semester, with both midterms and first projects due. However, I also need to consider (a) getting feedback to you before the midterm (so we can't push the due date past reading week) and (b) being fair to those people who have scheduled other activities over reading week.</p>
