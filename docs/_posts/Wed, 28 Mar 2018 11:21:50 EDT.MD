[quote]Hey, is it ok if I come by your office during exam season just to chat about general Computer Science stuff ...You know like Research in CS, career prospects in the field, why Grad school vs not grad school etc...? (Of course if someone needs  your help for 209 or 258 stuff, they get first priority to talk to you before me)[/quote]

<p>\n\nI don't have as many office hours during exams. (There's a post in the announcements with hours.) You're welcome to drop by, but I expect they'll mostly be busy.  \n\nIf you send me a note, we can set up a separate time to chat.</p>
