[quote]When you click on a video in PCRS, a green checkmark appears. I personally associated it with the green checkmarks for answering multiple choice questions. However, clicking a video does not affect my mark. You may want to consider some other symbol to indicate a video was clicked, instead of a green checkmark that is associated to being graded.[/quote]\n\nNoted -- thank you for the feedback!\n\nThat being said: when you click on a video (not watch it -- we can't guarantee that you've actually watched anything) -- there is an entry placed in the database, and some profs do provide marks based on whether you at least viewed the video for an instant.  Would your opinion change if a prof was marking based on videos?
