[quote=Anonymous]Can you post what you discussed on the friday lecture? I could not make it because of a conflict.[/quote]

<p>\n\nThere wasn't a Friday lecture. On Monday, we discussed how to make up the time lost to the snow day, and the class voted to have a midterm on the Friday after reading week. That frees up a lecture period in the week after reading week, letting us catch up.</p>
