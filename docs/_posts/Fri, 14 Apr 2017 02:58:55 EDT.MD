<p>\n\nFor when you get to CSC358: [i]protocols are important.[/i] It's critical that you define a shared language and then use it; otherwise, communication between machines isn't possible.\n\nBut 27% is pretty severe. Send in a remark request explaining the issue, and I'll take a look at it.\n\nAlso, please don't call me "Pete." That's nowhere near my name.</p>
