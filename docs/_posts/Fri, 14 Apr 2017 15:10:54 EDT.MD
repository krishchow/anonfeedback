[quote]What is a code review?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI assume you're referring to emails that I sent last night and have been sending today asking you to come in for a code review. This means that your assignment was very similar to other submitted at UTM, StG, or UTSc, so we'll need to review the code together to see why there is a similarity.</p>
