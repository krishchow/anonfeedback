[quote]If you are suspected of an academic offence on a lab, and if you plead guilty, if it is a single lab will it be just for the one lab mark as the wording in the handbook would suggest, and as such only 1/11 * 10%? Or would the offence decrease your mark more significantly. This is assuming first offence.[/quote]

<p>\n\nThe labs are a single item in our infosheet. The entire lab, of which each lab submission forms a component, is worth 10%.</p>
