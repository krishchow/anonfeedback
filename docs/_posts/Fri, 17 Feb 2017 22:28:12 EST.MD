[quote]Gonna fail A2....what should i do[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI hope you turned something in that we can test. Regardless: I recommend trying to complete a recursive walk. You'll need to build something very similar for A3, and you can probably use your A2 submission as the basis for it, as long as it's reasonably complete.</p>
