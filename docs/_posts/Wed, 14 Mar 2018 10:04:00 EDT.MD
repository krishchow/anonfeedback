[quote]How did you guys decide the CS POSt this year ? Last year we observed a 0.2 cGPA change from the year before but this year only a 0.1 cGPA increase, don't you think the cGPA is too low?[/quote]

<p>\n\nYou definitely need to be anonymous for this one. You'd get pilloried by your colleagues if they knew who you were.\n\nWe look at enrollments in 108 and 148, past trends in CGPA, and the availability of faculty when we make a decision about class size. This year, we only saw a small increase in 108/148 and hired a couple faculty, so we felt that we didn't need to increase the CGPA requirement significantly.</p>
