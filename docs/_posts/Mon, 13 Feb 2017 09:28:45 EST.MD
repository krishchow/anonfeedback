[quote]Curious as to why the CS courses have deadlines of 10 pm instead of 11:55 or 11:59 pm?[/quote]\n\nIt's partly arbitrary and partly practical. I've had midnight deadlines from time to time, and there's nothing particularly special about 10 p.m. (versus 5 p.m., which I'm using for CSC488 this term and which some downtown instructors prefer). \n\nHowever, I generally try to set deadlines at times when I will be online in case there are issues with the network or the system handling submissions. For 209, I [i]really[/i] need to be online, since the only timestamp that git really tracks is "commit time", and that can be faked on a local machine. So, for 209, about ten minutes after the deadline, I run a script to collect all repositories. I treat those submissions as being "on time". \n\n[quote]Also, would you please extend the A2 deadline to sunday at 10 pm instead of Friday?[/quote]\n\n[url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=4649&pid=15041#pid15041]Sorry, no.[/url]
