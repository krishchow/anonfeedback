[quote]1). Can you please continue to put "Exam like" questions on your slides? Will the exam have similar questions?

<p>\n\n2). Can you please tell us the format or breakdown of the exam like what topic each question covers(or something along that line)?[/quote]\n\nI'm glad you've found the exam-like questions helpful. I put in a couple since I've received some questions about how the exam and quizzes are related, and my response was that the format of the exam lends itself to more involved questions than the time-limited quizzes. I hope seeing a comparison demonstrates that.\n\nWe'll be discussing the exam on the last day of class. Past exams I have given are probably the best guide; you'll see that the format includes a few short answer questions that focus on definitions and then a number of problems like those recommended from the textbook.</p>
