[quote]Hi sir, if I did not do well on A2, would it be wise to stay in the course or drop it? [/quote]\n\nI'm hesitant to give you advice without knowing more about your specific situation, but here goes ...\n\nA2 is worth more than just the 10%. The midterm material draws from the lecture worksheets, labs, and assignments -- and the assignments are the culmination of much of that work. In addition, later assignments will rely on you using dynamic memory and handling errors in syscalls and user input in a natural way, so not doing well in A2 could signal that you will have extra work to do to complete those assignments.  \n\nSo I guess my answer is that if you didn't do well on A2 for reasons that can be fixed by the midterm and/or weren't related to the assignment content (too many other deadlines, a misunderstanding of the requirements, failing to commit the final version of your code, etc.), then A2 is just 10%, and you can make it up.  On the other hand, if you are struggling with error handling or dynamic memory, then there's a great deal of work to do before the midterm, and a weak performance on the midterm should trigger you to consider whether you can catch up this term.
