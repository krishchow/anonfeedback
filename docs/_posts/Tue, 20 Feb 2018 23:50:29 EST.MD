[quote]When are the emails going out for academic offenses?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI don't know, precisely. A department admin has the list of names of people that I'd like to interview. She is putting holds on records and checking if any of those students already have a first offense, and she will send the emails about interviews once that work is done and she has time to do so.</p>
