[quote]Were any linear adjustments applied to the marks? And what was the highest if you don't mind me asking?[/quote]

<p>\n\n[quote]Did you curve up? Can you tell us by how much? Also thanks for the fin course[/quote]\n\nNo, no adjustments were applied to the marks after calculating the average, except that I rounded up instead of just rounding. (If you earned a 76.001, you received a 77.) \n\nThe highest mark was a 99.</p>
