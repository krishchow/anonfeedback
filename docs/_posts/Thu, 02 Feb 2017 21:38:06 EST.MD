[quote]Why do you prefer vim? There are so many better alternatives. The only reason I'm still using vim is because I don't know how to get out of it.[/quote]

<p>\n\nHonestly, I don't know why I chose vi when I started programming. I mean, I remember using pine for email (and pine had a pico interface) , but ... okay, maybe that isn't any better, and it tells you how old I am.  \n\nI use vi now because (1) I tend to prefer keyboard based tools over ones that use the mouse, since I'm much faster with a keyboard, (2) I am lazy, and switching would mean learning new keyboard shortcuts (assuming I could find a system that I like better), (3) lots of colors, syntax highlighting, and auto-complete don't do anything for me, and (4) I've never been on a system that doesn't have vi.  \n\nBeyond that, define "better"? What do you use, and why is it better?</p>
