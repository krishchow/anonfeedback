[quote]What are your thoughts about the new APFS? I recently heard about it and saw some features of it that reminded me about this course. Do you think this file system would effect certain things that are done in this course such as a3 and a4.[/quote]

<p>\n\nI have no thoughts about it -- sorry! \n\nIn CSC369, we had an assignment a few years ago in which the students had to implement a file system. There are [i]thousands[/i] of file systems, so we just picked a fairly common one. I could imagine looking into APFS (or another modern system) to see if we can implement aspects of it. However, it's unlikely to change how teach 209, since the focus on 209 is on general principles and skills, rather than specific implementations.</p>
