[quote]Your Monday 1:30-2:45 office hours conflicts with the CSC290 lecture which is 1:00 - 3:00 and that is the only available lecture time slot. Can you change your Monday 1:30-2:45 office hours to Wednesday or Thursday? [/quote]

<p>\n\nI'm sorry, but no.\n\n1) I saw pretty heavy traffic in office hours yesterday, so it's a useful time for some people. I don't want to cancel the Monday hours. \n\n2) My schedule this term is pretty congested. I have some commitments that will take me downtown parts of Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday fairly regularly, so while I will be at UTM Friday morning and some Wednesdays and Thursdays, I can't commit to holding office hours every week. I would end up cancelling a bunch of them. However, if I'm in the office and have my door open, you're welcome to drop in to ask a question. (If my door is closed, please respect that I'm getting work done that has a deadline.)  \n\nI do have office hours on other days. Tuesday, I'm in the office 10-12 and Friday, I'll be in the office 10-11 and 12:30-1:30. Hopefully, one of those three other blocks will work for you.</p>
