[quote]Small typo on PCRS DISCOVER: Process Model Question 2 (about forks).[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThanks! It's fixed.\n\n[quote]For the Process Model PCRS, all the videos except the first have a proper title above the video. It would make sense for all the videos to have their title like the first video (I can still see the title from the actual video link, but it would be nice for consistency sake).[/quote]\n\nThanks! I'll make a note for next year.</p>
