[quote=Anonymous]When do you think we'll get exam/final grades?[/quote]\n\nSoon, I assume. Marks were submitted this weekend, and they're pending. The Chair needs to approve them.\n\n[quote=Anonymous]Also, how were the exams? Good or bad? ...I felt that it was a bit on the hard side, so the suspense is killing me![/quote]\n\nLower than I hoped. The low mark was 4.5 out of 60. The highest mark was 57 out of 60. The mean was 55% and the median was 60%. That suggests (and a scatterplot confirms) that a large number of scores were slightly above 60% and that low scores tended to be very low.
