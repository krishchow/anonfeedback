[quote]What's your expectation of the average of the midterm mark? Will you post average and median after grading all the papers?[/quote]\n\n... I can't give you an expectation, because I know the answer. Marking was finished today.\n\nI won't be posting the rubric or any marks until after deferred tests are written on Friday. If I post marks without explanations, people will want to know where they lost marks, and if we post a rubric now, the students taking that test will have more materials for studying than the main class. \n\nThe deferred / make-up tests won't be marked until the middle of next week (probably not before the March 14 drop deadline, for those of you in that situation).
