[quote]Can you post the solutions for the quizzes please? It would really help us out for the 50% final exam.[/quote]\n\nNo, because I strongly disagree that having the solutions will help you on the exam. Having the answer to a question won't help you directly; it'll just let you check your work. However, I'd rather that you know how to check your work. (For example, if you want to check the result of a k-map, you could enter the optimized equation in a truth table to make sure that it is the same function as the original.)  I'd be very happy, in office hours, to help you with checking your work, so you can do the same on the exam.
