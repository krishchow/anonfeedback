I'm posting these together, because ... yeah.

<p>\n\n[quote]"209 pcrs, on the other hand, is not interactive at all. We just end up watching some boring and vague videos." <-- I disagree. It would help if there were more coding problems, but the videos and transcripts have really helped me.[/quote]\n\n[quote]I am honestly finding the pcrs videos to be very unhelpful and extremely boring... I really hope you guys try to experiment with something else next year. I really thought it was well done for 108. It helped me do well in the class.[/quote]\n\nWe're gradually adding more problems to the PCRS set. Downtown has been experimenting with short answer questions, since much of the material isn't about coding, and if they work out, we'll integrate them next year.  \n\nIf you're not finding the video material to be useful, then you can skim the transcripts and code (linked below the videos) and then use the readings posted on the course webpage, instead.</p>
