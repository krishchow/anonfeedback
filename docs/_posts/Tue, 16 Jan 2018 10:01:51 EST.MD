[quote]The PCRS Errors need to be a little better. [/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI hear you, but ... it may be possible, and you're going to have to help me out.\n\nFirst, about helping me out: I need more details to understand what could be improved. Are you referring to all of the errors in general? Or to a specific problem? If the latter, could you be more specific, perhaps by providing the problem name and the error that you're finding difficult? Otherwise, I don't know where to start looking to make a fix ... so there won't be a fix. \n\nSecond, about it not being possible: C doesn't provide great errors.  You'll find, pretty quickly, that if a C program doesn't compile, the line number of the syntax error can be helpful but the message may not be. And if C fails in runtime, you're not going to get an error message that's useful at all. You'll get an abort trap or a segmentation fault, and both of those simply indicate that something got messed up in memory. We can't do much to improve that except to send you to a debugger.</p>
