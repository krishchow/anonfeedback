[quote]Is git bash ok?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nSo, a comment: this is not feedback, and I don't know why asking this question anonymously is beneficial. (I promise not to think less of you just because you have questions!) If anything, asking this question anonymously makes things more challenging because I can't ask for clarification or ask follow-up questions. In this case, I don't know what you mean by "git bash". So, could you just post this on the board, in a normal thread, so we can chat back and forth?</p>
