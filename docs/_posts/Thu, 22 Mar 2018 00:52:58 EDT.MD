[quote]Sometimes it is hard to follow you on the black board, is it possible for you to improve on your slides. An example was the wires that you did in this weeks class. I was looking online and found https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse378/07au/lectures/L12-Forwarding.pdf. Doing something like this is easy for everyone to follow.[/quote]\n\nI've experimented with using a tablet to annotate slides in class. The tech wasn't up to it the last time I tried it (the lag was bad enough while transmitting the slides that it affected pacing), but I'll look into it again.
