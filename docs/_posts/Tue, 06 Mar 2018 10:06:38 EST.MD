[quote]Hey professor, when a professor responds to our email, is it better to reply with another "thank you" email? I am afraid I might be spamming their inbox with unnecessary emails, but I also do not want to come off rude. What are your thoughts on this?[/quote]

<p>\n\nI wouldn't consider emails to profs to be a special case. \n\nIf someone has done something routine, then no "thank you" is required, though in some cases, an acknowledgement (so they know you received the info or that the thing they did is visible/has made an impact) could be helpful. If someone has done something out of the ordinary for you, then a "thank you" would be polite.  \n\nJust do what you'd do with anyone else in a business / professional setting.</p>
