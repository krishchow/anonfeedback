[quote]Hello Prof, 
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nCan you post some solutions for lab 10? I got it to work somewhat but later during the GDB part, I noticed my inbuf value was greater than the size of the buffer and I couldn't end up resolving that issue without breaking the code. \n\n I really need some sort of step by step guide or solutions that I can use to see where I'm going wrong. I would appreciate it a lot if you posted them.\n\nThanks![/quote]\n\nNo, sorry. I'm happy to talk through your algorithm with you, but the effort of debugging and identifying the problem is what I'm looking for you to perform.</p>
