[quote]We are always having definition questions in our quiz, which is not useful in my point. Can you give more calculation or design questions but not those "what is xxx" questions please?[/quote]\n\nI'm sorry, but no -- absolutely not. \n\nIn computer science, we often brush off the value of memorization and put more value on higher-level cognitive skills like application and synthesis. (I do it, too. We just value problem solving and creation.) We certainly don't require you to memorize as many facts as other disciplines, but there's still value in having a shared vocabulary. If I say, "datapath," and you don't know what I mean -- or worse, if you and I have different definitions -- then we can't communicate. There are a few definitions you must know for us to talk.
