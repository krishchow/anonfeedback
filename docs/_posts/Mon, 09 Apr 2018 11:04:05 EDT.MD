[quote]... apparently you have an open door policy for office hours. How open does your door have to be for the open door policy to come into effect? Also, your door says no knocking, so how do we let you know that we want to come in? [/quote]\n\nIf it's open at all, knock or just stick your head in and say hello. If it's closed, please don't. I'm often on skype in the mornings, because I work with people in Finland.
