[quote]Is it automatic 0, if we get an interview for academic offense, or do we get 10% taken off of the assignment?[/quote]

<p>\n\nI can't give you an answer for certain. The instructor's job is to investigate; the penalties are set by the Chair or, if the case is referred to the Dean's office, by the Dean or a designate.  \n\nThat being said, penalties tend to follow patterns. Typically, for a first offense that's handled at the department level, you'll see a 0 on the marked item. For a second offense, the case has to be handled at the Dean's office, and the penalty is usually a 0 in the course, suspension, and a transcript annotation.</p>
