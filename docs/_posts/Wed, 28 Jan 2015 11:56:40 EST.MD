<p>\nI've asked the TAs to send me marks for this week, but I haven't yet seen them. I'll review them before posting. [/quote]\nI've reviewed the marks, and they seem fine. Students who attended and made progress were awarded full credit. The TAs also noted who brought a prelab to class -- and hence, who was able to complete the circuit before the lab finished -- and I awarded a bonus point to those students. \n\nIn the future: not having completed the pre-lab will likely make it very difficult to demonstrate progress. That [i]could[/i] negatively impact your mark.</p>
