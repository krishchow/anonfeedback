[quote]Thank you for teaching us this semester! You have done an amazing job organizing this course and making this course so engaging through the use of different technologies and softwares to help us continually develop our skills throughout the semester. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas Holidays and have a Happy New Year! Hope you teach us again in the upper years![/quote]\n\nThank you! I'm sure I'll see you in the next few years. This year, I'm teaching CSC209 (systems programming) and CSC488 (compilers). I'm also likely to teach some combination of CSC258 (computer organization), CSC263 (data structures), CSC358 (networks), and CSC369 (operating systems) in the future.
