[quote]For csc490, the capstone design course, how is the topic chosen? The one happening this semester is about video games and I feel like it's a waste of time because after 4 years of university, the final project is a game, instead of something that's useful.[/quote]

<p>\n\nIt's the instructor's choice. They have to be comfortable with the topic and technologies being used.\n\nSo, setting aside that I wouldn't do a game design capstone (because I don't have any experience in the area), why is it such a bad idea? You could get into UX, user testing, graphics, AI, optimizing for performance, software engineering; it doesn't seem like a bad choice for a capstone to me ... ?</p>
