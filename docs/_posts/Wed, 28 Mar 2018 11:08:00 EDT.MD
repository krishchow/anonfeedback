[quote]Will the changes for CS POSt that are effective in the 2018-2019 calendar (the minimum mark in CSC148 and MAT102 being greater than 65) affect people who have applied during the 1st round for which the acceptances come out in May or will the changes only affect people who are applying to POSt AFTER taking Summer courses that is in the 2nd round ?
