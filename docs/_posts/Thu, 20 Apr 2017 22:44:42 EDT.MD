[quote]What was the course average?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\n... Acorn will probably tell you, eventually. But I urge you not to compare yourself against an "average". \n\nIf you earned an A or a B in this course, then I'll look forward to seeing you in CSC369. If you earned a C or if you struggled with the assignments, then I strongly recommend doing some practice work before taking a systems course that is based on C. With a D, I do not recommend moving on to systems courses without some serious reflection about what went badly in this course and what you can do to make sure your next encounter with systems work goes more smoothly.</p>
