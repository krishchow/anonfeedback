[quote]Can you make the labs "open" please? The material is starting to get confusing and I really need help on Wednesdays and Thursdays where you don't hold any office hours.[/quote]\n\nI'll revisit this question in a couple weeks, but right now, I'm sorry to have say, "No." \n\nAfter I received your message, I sent the TAs an email asking how the labs were going and if they felt they could accommodate additional students in their labs for questions. The answer, from all the TAs who have responded so far, is that the labs remain full, that in some cases they do not have enough computers for everyone who attends, and that they feel busy as is. I'll ask again in a couple weeks, once we start the assembly section of the course, as I suspect the labs will quiet down then.\n\nIf I could ask a question back: In the past, I've offered to explore other office hours times, but you (I assume I'm talking to one person, though it could be a few?) seem quite insistent on Wednesday. Why won't Monday/Tuesday work ... ?
