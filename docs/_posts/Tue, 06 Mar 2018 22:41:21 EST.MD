[quote]Did you actually code 27,000,000 lines of code? [/quote]\n\nNo. There is no way I wrote 27M lines of code. Writing [i]one line of code per second[/i], working 16 hours per day, 7 days per week, it would take 66 weeks to write 27 million lines of code.  (That's actually a lot less time than I thought.)\n\nHowever, I worked on the windows codebase, and at the time, it had roughly 27 million lines of code. It now has 40 million or so.
