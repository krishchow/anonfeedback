[quote]For CS post what do you think the numbers will be around this year? Seeing that you have taught 108 and now 209 so you have a good idea of averages, and so forth. From what I can tell is that majority of the students whether it be 1st year or 2nd year, they are struggling with a lot of concepts in general. Technically, I know it will be until May. You best guess, an estimate. Historically, what have the CGPA averages been?[/quote]

<p>\n\nHistorically, the required average has been 2.0. We haven't had to enforce a prerequisite requirement since 2000 (long before I was faculty here).  \n\nAny number I give you would truly just be a guess, so I'd prefer to not speculate on what the cut-off will be this year.</p>
