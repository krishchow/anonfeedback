[quote]Hi Dan, I might be failing my MAT137 course, what happens if I fail, will I have to retake it again next year? I feel I would be able to pass MAT135 easily but now I am stuck in MAT137. [/quote]

<p>\n\nIf you do not pass calculus, you will need to take a calculus course to graduate, but it need not be MAT137. You could take MAT135 instead, if you feel that is a better option for you.</p>
