[quote]I am looking at my a3 results and it says the tests you did on TestDirectory and Testdirectory2 fail completely it says that everything about them fails but I have tested multiple directories with many subdirectories inside one another and each time it succeeded and gave me correct processes used? I am not understanding how everything about it fails[/quote]

<p>\n\nThis shouldn't be sent to anonymous feedback. Without your name, I can't look at your code and tests to help you figure out what is going on.  \n\nSo: it could be an error in the tests? Or it could be how we called the program versus how you expected the program to be called? You need to send me an email or, preferably, to visit office hours so we can investigate.</p>
