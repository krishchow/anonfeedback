[quote]Is it possible you could release the readings for the week after reading week?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nSorry! It's not ready yet. If you browse the directory the guides are in, you can see the guide for the last time I taught the course, but I haven't re-read what was recommended or done the exercises, so there are likely to be some changes. I'm hoping to get that done by Tuesday.</p>
