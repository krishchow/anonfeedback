[quote]I understand that an academic offence is an academic offence, however is there any way for mercy? Meaning can it be dropped to a lesser offence depending on whether it is a lab or assignment?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nPenalties for first offenses tend to apply specifically to the work in which the offense was committed (meaning that an offense in a lab will apply to the 10% lab mark and in an assignment will apply only to the 10% assignment). However, there isn't a sense of "more or less serious offense" in the code.</p>
