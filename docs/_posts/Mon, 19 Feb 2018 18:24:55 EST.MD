[quote]Do profs work over reading week?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nYes, but in many cases, it won't be work that you'll see. Reading week is an opportunity to get work done that takes a block of uninterrupted time: research, midterm writing, assignment prep, administrative duties, etc. I think most of us cancel office hours and spend the time away from students.</p>
