[quote]Students from one lab are sharing questions with other students in later labs.
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nTo make quizzes fair, just tell everyone, before the labs, that the questions will be two of the following 5 types. \n\nThen, give each lab different questions from the 5 types.\n\nStudents aren't sharing any information that is new.[/quote]\n\nThat's what's already happening. The reading guides tell you what terms you should know (i.e., which you should be able to define) and then provide a set of exercises you should be able to complete. The questions I ask on the quizzes are (a) about the terms I've asked you to know or (b) are simplified versions of the questions in the exercises.</p>
