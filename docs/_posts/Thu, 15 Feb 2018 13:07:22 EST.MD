[quote]Is the midterm going to be hard? How were the averages for previous years?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI don't have a good answer to, "is X going to be difficult?" I mean, I try to evaluate the things we've practiced in labs and assignments, but while that might be obvious to one person, it could be quite challenging for another.\n\nMidterm averages last year were low -- in the 50's -- and that caused consternation in the class and in the group of instructors.</p>
