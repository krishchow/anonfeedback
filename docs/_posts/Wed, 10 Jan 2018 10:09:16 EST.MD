[quote='kaursach' pid='24088' dateline='1515557828']\nIs it possible that either during the summer or next year students could work on the PCRs?[/quote]\n\nYes. I don't know if I'll have funds to pay for a developer this year, but in the past two years, we've hired two students to work on the system over the summer and have hired a work study to help with maintenance over the fall-winter.\n\nIn the past, I've also offered CSC492 (independent study) credit for people building interesting extensions to PCRS. For example, I'm currently playing with the idea of using a theorem prover to automatically evaluate constrained proof-construction problems, and that might be something that would be interesting to explore from a course standpoint.
