[quote]Just some thoughts on the 2nd assignment:\nI thought it was nice. With the exception of the get_odd_palindrome_at function I found the assignment to be challenging but do-able, especially since we were allowed to ask questions on the discussion board. I do wish we were taught about test cases before doing the assignment and on what can be considered a valid input. The get_odd_palindrome_at function was kind of hard though, especially if you didn't know how to use break in your loops. [/quote]\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts.
