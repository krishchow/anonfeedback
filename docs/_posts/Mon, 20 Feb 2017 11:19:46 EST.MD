I've received a number of comments regarding reweighting A2:
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\n[quote]In a lot of courses, your lowest assignment is weighed the least or your lowest quiz is weighed the least. Do you think a similar thing could be employed for CSC209? \n\nMy reasoning is that, this recent assignment really did not go well and 10% of a final mark is a substantial amount to be determined by automated testing. [/quote]\n\n[quote]If a lot of people did bad can you just take the highest mark from assignment 2 and next assignment and make it 15% and 5% for the lower grade?[/quote]\n\nI'd like to wait on commenting on these until I have some sense of how the assignment went.</p>
