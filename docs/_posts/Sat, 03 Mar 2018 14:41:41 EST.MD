[quote]Have you spoken to the TAs about their thoughts on this year's course?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nYes, and some have shared concerns about issues with Quartus and with being consistent with marking. However, we have an employment relationship, so they probably don't feel comfortable offering criticism about the course itself or about me.\n\nAlso, most of these TAs have taken the course with someone else, since only one of them was around when I was teaching this course. As a result, they have covered somewhat different material; most of them, for example, did not cover material related to latency, but they did more work with digital design (and were always required to put their designs onto the FPGA boards for credit).</p>
