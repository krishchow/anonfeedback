[quote]when completing labs and assignments, would you recommend restarting the computer right away to free up unfreed/lost memory or would the programs not affect the performance of the computer much when we're not working on these programs.[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nNo, you shouldn't need to restart anything. When a program terminates, all of the memory allocated to the process (including memory that your program has lost track off -- the leaked memory) is freed up. Leaking memory is a problem in long-running programs and resident code like dynamic libraries.  \n\nWhy do we put such an emphasis on it, then? For practice. We want you to clean things up now, so that you know how to do so on a program that is expected to run in the background constantly.</p>
