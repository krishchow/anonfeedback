[quote=Anonymous]Since your class already, sort of, borders this, I was wondering: could explain how memresistors work? How do they store data while doing logic?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI'm not sure that I know what you're referring to. I'm guessing you're asking about memristers -- fairly newly developed circuit elements that could be used as non-volatile memory. A memrister is a device which has a variable resistance. The resistance changes depending on how much current has been applied in the past -- and which direction the current flowed. By testing the resistance, you can determine the charge that flowed, and that lets you use it as storage. However, as far as I know, they aren't being used to perform logical operations.</p>
