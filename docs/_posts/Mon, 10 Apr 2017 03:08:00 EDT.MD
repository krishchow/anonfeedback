[quote]I know for a fact that if you had allowed groups for A4, I wouldn't have contributed as much as my partner. I would have been busy working on the final project for another tough CSC course while he would have taken the lead.

<p>\n\nI'm glad I did 100 percent of the work instead of 30. I probably won't get a very high mark since I ran into some problems with paralell struct sending, but make no mistake, not having groups was the correct decision. Extending the deadline by a day was also a very good decision. [/quote]\n\nYeah. I've seen this often in third year courses, with one student taking on operating systems and the other member of the team doing 363/373.  \n\nIn any case, I hope you're wrong about the mark.</p>
