[quote]Can we get better solution specifications and something to test our code with for the labs? It's frustrating when you understand the material but get 0 on a lab because you just dont have any idea if you got the vague specifications correctly.[/quote]

<p>\n\nCould you tell me what you found vague about the last lab, so I can improve it for next year?\n\nMost of the errors I saw on the lab were silly (typos, issues in formatting, etc.), which is why I'm offering a resubmit this Friday. The other common error, though -- writing a script to be usable generally, instead of in one specific location -- is something that's important.</p>
