[quote]So what if I don't get a 65 or above in 209 but have above a 65 in 148. Can I get into the specialist?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nDo you [i]want[/i] to get into the specialist with less than a 65 in 209? The specialist requires a number of systems courses, like CSC369 and CSC358.  \n\nBeyond that, it's possible to get into the specialist without a 65 in 209. The requirement is for a 65 in CSC148, and we check the second year courses as an alternate form of entry (not as a requirement).</p>
