[quote]What happens if we fail, say MAT137? Do we need to take the whole class again next year and get in to a major/minor/specialist a year later than usual? Is there another way not to waste a year, maybe like getting accepted to a major conditionally and retaking the failed course & start taking our program courses in the same year?[/quote]\n\nWe don't accept students into the POSt conditionally, but the CS minor is unrestricted.
