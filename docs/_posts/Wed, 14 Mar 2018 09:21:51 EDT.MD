[quote]What is the best way to study for the exam in your opinion? How should we study the topics that we learnt at the beginning of the course? I feel like I might have forgotten some of the stuff we learnt at the beginning of the course. [/quote]

<p>\n\nI'd review the assigned exercises. Then, towards the end of the term, I'd pull a couple of old exams, complete them, and then use those to decide which topics to spend more time on.\n\nHowever, I'd also say: if you did the exercises each week and did well in the quizzes, you probably don't need to study much.</p>
