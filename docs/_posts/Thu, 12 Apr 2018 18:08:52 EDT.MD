[quote]Why are St. George CS POSt requirements astronomically higher than UTM's ? Does this difference mean anything to employers ? and are the new requirements (73 in Mat102  and csc148) a step toward having similar requirements to saint george ?[/quote]\n\nFor the second question: That's not our intention, and I hope it's not what occurs. The higher requirements go, the more we're dissuading people from trying and the more stress we're putting on the population. We added some flexibility on course marks to try to release a little bit of pressure on CGPA and to dissuade students from taking a year off to study <insert your favorite bird subject> to raise their GPA.\n\nFor the first question: It's mostly a matter of demand. StG is perceived to be more prestigious, and downtown is better known internationally. They get far more applicants per seat in the POSt than we do.
