[quote]Is St George A3 and ours the same? [/quote]\n\nThey're related. \n\n[b]Edit:[/b] I guess I should say "but not identical." We often change them a bit, to suit personal preference, to better match things that have come up in our particular lectures, etc.\n\nWe often collaborate on assignments, since the goal of the first and second year courses is to get the students prepared to take third year courses on either campus. It also helps improve the assignments: building an assignment can take a huge amount of time -- and a mistake can be very disruptive on students -- so it helps to have lots of faculty working on each one. (And even then, people will say it's vague. :) )\n\nFor example, Prof. Dema wrote the initial idea for A2, I wrote most of the first draft and the starter code, and downtown did the final handout draft and added diagrams. For A3, they wrote the first draft, and we wrote the solution and are modifying the handout for UTM (since they are using TAs to mark and we need to use scripts, we have to specify more requirements).
