[quote]One of the supposed wrong answers for Follow-Up Question 2 for w8's PCRS is "If you don't close all the pipes and file descriptors before the program terminates, the operating system will eventually run out of file descriptors" however the video says that this can happen, so perhaps this answer will mistakenly labelled "wrong"[/quote]

<p>\n\nNo, that option is correctly marked "wrong". \n\nThe video is also correct. It notes: "In a [b]long running program[/b], it is important to close descriptors that are no longer needed because the number of open file descriptors is limited, and it is possible to run out." That quote is speaking about the possibility of running out of file descriptors [i]within a process[/i] if you don't close them as you no longer needing them. Once the process terminates, all of the resources it is using (including memory and file descriptors) are released.\n\nAs an aside: It's possible to set both "hard" (set by the sys admin) and "soft" (set by the process itself, as a sort of error check) limits on the number of concurrently open files within a process. Hard limits are a security measure; they keep a process from maliciously taking over all of the file resources on a system. As a result, the OS is in no realistic danger of running out of file descriptors.</p>
