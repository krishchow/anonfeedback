[quote]I don't understand why are you taking only the Fall term averages with the # of applicants for post should you be taking the fall and winter averages as well. That's what Arnold told me he did last year. That should lessen the  cgpa,it's too high compared to last year![/quote]\n\nNo, waiting until the winter term marks are factored into CGPAs wouldn't significantly change the admissions cutoff. The higher CGPA cutoff this year is largely a function of an increase in the number of applicants, not a difference in how the cutoff was calculated.
