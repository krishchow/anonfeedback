[quote]When I try going to the link for Verilog in this weeks lab handout. I get this error: 
<!-- more -->
<p>\nNot Found\n\nThe requested URL /verilog/verilog one day.html was not found on this server.\n\nIm trying to go to the "Verilog in one day" link. Is this an error on my behalf or is the link invalid? [/quote]\n\nThe link works okay for me. However, I note that in anonymous feedback, at least, the link you sent includes spaces, and the link in the handout has underscores. Did the underscores get turned into spaces when you copied and pasted?</p>
