[quote]what do you think of arnold rosenbloom as a course instructor? [/quote]\n\nI've never taken a class from Prof. Rosenbloom, so I can't answer this question effectively. Beyond that, I won't render public judgement on the abilities of my colleagues.\n\nThat being said: as a person, I find him to be energetic, enthusiastic, and compassionate. I know that if I run into trouble, I can ask him for help, and he'll go out of his way. I also think of him as an idea generator: if you need twelve possible solutions to a problem, he's a good person to speak to.
