[quote]... snip ... I just want your opinion on something. If you were to design web app that would eventually make its way to iOS and Android, for front end would you recommend using Angular JS or React JS?[/quote]

<p>\n\nSo, I've worked with React  more than Angular. I found React to be fairly easy to pick up, and it did a good job for the fairly simple (PCRS) interface items we wanted to build. I used Angular briefly and the learning curve, at the time, was more steep.\n\nI think if I were to make the choice now, I'd look into Angular 2. However, since I'm fairly happy with React, I wouldn't switch unless there was a tech reason to do so.\n\nAlso: I see lots of anonymous feedback in the mail box, but answers might be delayed as I work through marking. Apologies!</p>
