[quote]the pcrs videos aren't too helpful. they are very slow and boring and even when doing pcrs and 10 am they make me sleepy. even the text version is just a big blob of words it isn't even easy to follow without any visual. [/quote]\n\nWhen I review the videos each week, I generally watch them at 2x speed for the same reason (or just read the transcript). She's speaking very carefully and deliberately.\n\nYou might try downloading the code (there is often code available with the transcripts) and editing / playing with it, so that you're doing something active instead of just watching the video. You can use the transcript as a resource for answering questions about the code, if you get stumped.\n\nIn any case, I'm sorry they're not helping you out!
