<p>\n\nI'm sorry you're struggling with this assignment. \n\nThis material is quite challenging the first time you encounter it. It requires changing your perspective: being more responsible for handling errors yourself and being more aware of the system (in particular memory). That takes practice (it's not an intelligence thing). \n\nWill A3 be challenging? Yes, but differently so. Memory will still be an issue, but it'll be less directly an issue, and you'll be asked to focus on the [i]process[/i] resources available on the system.</p>
