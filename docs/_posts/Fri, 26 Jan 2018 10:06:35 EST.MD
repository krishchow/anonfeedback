[quote]Have you ever dealt with imposter syndrome (inability to internalize accomplishments, fear of being exposed as a fraud despite genuine efforts) as a student or instructor? It seems to be very prominent in this day and age, people just aren't aware that it's a thing.[/quote]\n\nOften. The latter half of graduate school was a particular low point for me.\n\nIt's become better (easier to handle) as I've gotten older and realized that, speaking broadly, (a) people often make it up as they go along and (b) people are absorbed in themselves and don't particularly pay attention to others. That is to say: people who truly understand what they are doing are rare, and the person who will scrutinize you the most closely and harshly is you. I just try to do my best and handle things as they come.
