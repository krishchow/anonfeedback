[quote]Which version of English do you use? I searched most of the major versions and could not find a definition for the word &quot;postd&quot; which is found on this page:\n[url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~209/assignments.shtml]https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~209/assignments.shtml[/url]\n\nAlso which version of c will you be using to mark our assignments? I don't think the difference between c99 and c11 will affect the results much, but I think there are some important differences between ansi c and c99.[/quote]\n\nIt's "typo English."  But you knew that.  \n\nWe'll be using these flags when marking: "-Wall -std=c99" The first won't make much of a difference to our marking, but I strongly recommend that you use it during development. The second could alter how your code compiles, so it's also important to include as you develop and test.\n\nAs an aside: "ANSI C" usually refers to "C89", but I'd avoid the term if possible. Both ANSI and ISO are organizations that approve standards, and they've both approved C89 [i]and[/i] C99 (at different times and sometimes with different names).  \n\nAnother note: Why not C11? It's the current standard, and we lose Generics, some threading support, and a few other language features by not using it. However, the amount of resources online for C11 is still a bit sparse, and for the basic C that we're using, there aren't any observable differences.
