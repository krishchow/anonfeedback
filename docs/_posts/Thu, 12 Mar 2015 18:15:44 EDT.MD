[quote=Anonymous]Whats the point of having at least 40% on exams to pass the course? By UofT standards if we get a 50 than we get the credit and so if I get 50 with a grade like 35% on a 40% final then I think I deserve to pass, especially since most of the course content is testbased anyways.[/quote]

<p>\n\nI aim to make 60% of the marks on any test "core" material -- material that is derived directly from the learning outcomes of the course. If someone is earning less than 2/3 of that, then I don't think they've demonstrated mastery of the core material, and I don't think they should get the credit.\n\nIn a course with a large amount of project or assignment work, the 40% cutoff that many CS courses use is also intended to encourage individual responsibility. That (mostly) doesn't apply here.</p>
