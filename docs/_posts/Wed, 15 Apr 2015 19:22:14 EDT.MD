[quote=Concerned Student]I saw the post about pink hippos/deers. Any updates?[/quote]\n\nYour post started a spirited discussion about the feasibility of chipping into a fund to order patches. The faculty at UTM are not especially into plushies.  \n\nIn the past, for operating systems, I organized a t-shirt design and print run. It ended up costing about $20 per student to get a shirt after final exams (and marks were posted). Classes were a lot smaller then. Patches look more feasible. It's looking like $5-7 for a large run.
