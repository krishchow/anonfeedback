[quote]Is there a particular reason due to which you never seem to teach 148?[/quote]\n\nYou're right -- I've only taught it once. I think it's a matter of timing. We try to keep instructors from teaching both 108 and 148 (sorry, Prof. Maccio!) because both courses are a fairly heavy load and because students benefit, especially early on, from having very different instructional experiences. The courses I used to be assigned regularly -- CSC258 and CSC369 -- were both winter term courses a few years ago, so I was free for the fall term (108) but not the winter. Now, with 258 and 209, I remain busier in the winter.
