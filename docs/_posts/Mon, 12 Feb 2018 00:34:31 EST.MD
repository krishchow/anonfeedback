[quote]Can you hold extra office hours for A2?[/quote]\n\nI'm not sure yet. I know that I'll need to cancel Friday morning office hours. If I don't have to be downtown Wednesday morning or Friday afternoon, I can schedule a few more hours. I won't know for another day or so. Once my schedule this week is settled, I'll post an announcement.
