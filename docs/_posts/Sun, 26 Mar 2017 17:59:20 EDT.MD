<p>\n\nTwo things in this post jumped out at me: "yeah, I get it. There's a three way handshake. socket makes a socket, connect connects. But can you tell me what all these system calls mean? What select does with nfds and readfds and writefds and exceptfds and fmlfds?" This is particularly important (well, except for "fmlfds"). The questions OP asks are why we're studying this material, and on the exam, I'll be asking similar questions: what is [i]select[/i] doing? Why do we need to use it? Why do we need multiple copies of the fd sets?\n\nAnd "do I get bonus points if I guess when A2 marks will be released?" Yeah. I'm sorry about the A2 marks -- they are far too delayed. It's complicated, and we're working on it.</p>
