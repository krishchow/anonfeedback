[quote]Hello dear sir, when you said there will be a 20% mark deduction for resubmission. Does this mean that if we submit a remark, it'll actually be possible for the remark to have a lower grade than our original mark? I'm scared because of this case but I assume you guys will choose the higher of the 2 marks?

<p>\n\nLike if we got a 50% before resubmission, and after submission we get a 68%, does this mean we will end up just getting a 48% (because of 20% mark deduction).[/quote]\n\nIt's possible that your second mark will be lower than your first mark. Yes, we take the higher of the two.</p>
