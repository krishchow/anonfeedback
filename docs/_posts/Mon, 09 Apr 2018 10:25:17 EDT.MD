[quote]With respect, I understand you are unable to extend the deadline date for the resubmits. Would it be possible to set the deadline time from 10:00PM to 11:59PM to at least give us a bit more time to fix up our code if required. I acknowledge that by extending the deadline it may hurt some students or benefit students, however, by extending it just for 2 hours, not only do students who need the small extra time can utilize this time to help them but also for those who are ready to submit can also have the two extra hours to implement any final things to make sure it is guarantee to work under the tests. My point is, there seems to be nothing to lose from this and it provides a little extra time under a stressed timeframe. Can this consideration be made please?[/quote]
