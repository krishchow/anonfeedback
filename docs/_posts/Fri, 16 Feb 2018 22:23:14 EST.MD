[quote]Hey professor, I would prefer if you start sending emails for more important announcements. Such as when the results for tests are sent or when you accept re-submission for lab week 2. Arnold sent way too much email in 207 and now you don't send any XD.[/quote]\n\nSorry, but no, I'm not going to start spamming email. As noted the infosheet, the discussion board is "required reading" because I post announcements on the board. (I prefer that to email because the board contains a lot of assignment and lab related info, and I want you here to see that traffic.) If you want an email when an announcement is posted, you can subscribe to the sub-board you care about (announcements, assignments, etc.)
