<p>\n[quote=Anonymous]Pretty fair exam. My hand hurts tho.[/quote]\n[quote=Anonymous]So I studied, went to office hours and seeked extra resources and still found the exam to be quite challenging. I think the problem was that you either knew the question fully or you didn't. Even not knowing a small part of it caused me to mess up. Thank you for the good structure in the class - I recognized all the topics and for the most part, their were no surprises on the exam; it was just a matter of knowing how to answer. Have a great summer![/quote]\n[quote=Anonymous]that exam was hard![/quote]\n[quote=Anonymous]Thanks for not putting a FSM question on the exam.[/quote]\n\nMarking is scheduled for Monday. It will probably take an extra two or three days for me to finish marking and to get marks through the system. Good luck with your other exams!</p>
