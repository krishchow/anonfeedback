[quote]I understand that you do not offer links, cites, etc, for Linux downloads or virtual machines because there are too many flavours of Linux. Since our C code for assignments is required to run on the lab computers, shouldn't downloads or link of the same standard as the lab computers be available?[/quote]\n\nYou have a Google, and you may use it. \n\nThat's trite, but bluntly: when it comes to technical information, it's time to learn what questions to ask, instead of expecting answers to be given to you. You were a second year CS student, and you're about to be a third year CS student. If you want to set up linux, there are many resources online to help you do so, and if you want to set up the same environment as at UTM, it's as simple as looking up "how do I figure out what version of linux this is?" ("uname") and then looking for that distro.\n\n[quote]So that way there won't be as many issues for compiling on from home verse the lab computers.[/quote]\n\nOr you can use ssh.
