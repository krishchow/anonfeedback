<p>\n\nI shouldn't take credit for doing something I didn't do ... I mean, there just weren't that many testcases. By design, the assignment rules out most of the edge cases that might be problematic; the assignment is intended to focus on getting used to C and to give you a chance to get used to how we mark in this class (i.e., use the linux machines for testing, report errors appropriately, use the [i]Makefile[/i] to compile, ...)</p>
