[quote]Hey there, 
<!-- more -->
<p>\nI just wanted to notify you on the second lab, all I can say is that it was reaaaaaaaally long, I know it said that in the lab and told us to finish it during the week, the thing is we are new to using bash and having to do it after the lab made it harder since there is no one to ask for help. I hope that the labs wonâ€™t be long as this one was. \n\nThanks[/quote]\n\nYes, the second lab is pretty long if the shell isn't familiar. Most labs will be shorter, but there will be the occasional long one (usually right before an assignment is posted).  \n\nIf you need extra help, please come into office hours or post on the board. I'm seeing lots of fast responses here.</p>
