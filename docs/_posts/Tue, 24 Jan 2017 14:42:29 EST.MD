[quote]Can you use the naming conventions of firstSecond instead of first_second in future PCRS, assignments, Etc. It's a minor thing but I find it easier and faster to type variables and functions with the first naming convention.[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nCamelCase is generally not found in C or C++ libraries: it's not the convention that is used. UPPERCASE is used for constants, and pothole case tends to be used for functions. (You'll also see lowercase concatenated, like strncat. Pothole is more common with C++.)\n\nThe exception is types: you'll sometimes see CamelCase used to name structs or things that are typedef'd. (I think the GTK+ standard does this.) \n\nSo, bottom line: we don't always get to choose our conventions. We might prefer one or another (I tend to prefer pothole, for what it's worth), but we should generally accommodate the conventions of the group we're working in or the tools we are working with.</p>
