[quote]Is it possible to get the solutions to the midterm so we can see how it's done?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nSure. I've updated the midterm posted. However, I [i]strongly, strongly[/i] warn you against just reading the solutions and saying, "Oh, that's how it's done." Read it. Then step away for 20 minutes. Then recreate it [i]without looking at it[/i]. Then try to do something slightly different. Then go back to the worksheet on the topic and see if you can write the code for the worksheet (from scratch). Once you can produce, it's yours. Just seeing it probably won't help when you next encounter a related problem.</p>
