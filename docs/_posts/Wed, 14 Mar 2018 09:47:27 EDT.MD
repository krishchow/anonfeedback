[quote]I have been following the 2018 CS POSt thread and I had a question about LWD. Suppose there is a first year student currently taking CSC148.. This student has an upcoming test that is worth 20% of their grade. The same student won't find out what they get on the test until after the drop deadline. Suppose the student does very poorly on the test and wishes to retake CSC148 in the summer. Would the student still be able to apply (and hopefully get in) to POSt if they do well enough in the summer? It is a bit confusing, as it is obvious that you cannot c/ncr a POSt requirement, but would this still apply for LWD?

Still, you ... errr ... your friend ... is posting to an anonymizing script, so you're just "anonymous student" to me.  \n\nIn any case: an LWD doesn't affect your CGPA, so it shouldn't have any impact on your ability on the requirements we evaluate when admitting a student to the program.</p>
