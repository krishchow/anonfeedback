[quote][quote]Please don't send remark requests yet: it'll make it harder for me to respond to student questions about A4. (Thanks!) [/quote]

<p>\n\nGood sir when would you like us to send remark requests then? Tomorrow (Saturday April 1st?)\nI've also never sent in a remark request, nor does it say anything about it on the assignments page, should we just send you an email with the problem we had and why we want a remark?[/quote]\n\nOnce marks for A2 actually post, you'll get an email like the one [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=5008]linked here[/url] that we sent for A1. At that point, please send me remark requests, as described in that email.\n\nThanks for your patience!</p>
