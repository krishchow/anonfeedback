[quote]I was wondering if I can ask for an extension for the PCRS. till mid-night today will be fine too.

<p>\nI am just stuck on debugging the online code we have to write out. [/quote]\n\n[quote]thank you so much for the extension;all debugged and perfect.[/quote]\n\nI'm glad you were able to get it debugged, and I wish I could claim that I had helped ... but I didn't provide an extension. A few weeks ago, someone asked (via anonymous feedback) if the deadline for the Friday exercises could be pushed to midnight, so all Friday exercises already have a deadline of 11:59 p.m.  So, yay -- but it wasn't me.</p>
