[quote]Hello professor
<!-- more -->
<p>\nThe speed that you are going at is a bit fast but manageable, however, is it possible for you to slow down just a tad when you are teaching something new. For ex, Tuesday's lecture you showed us how to make a transistor and kmap, but you explained things a bit too quickly. For those moments, when you're showing something on the board, if you could go through the first example that you do a bit slower. For the rest of the examples you do and general lecture, the norm speed is fine. Thanks[/quote]\n\nThanks for the note. I really need your help to implement this, though. I'm moving quickly because a lot of what I'm doing is pointing out or identifying points from examples similar to those in the text. I'm assuming that many of the features are familiar but that the meaning behind them is not. If you have a question about a step or about why I'm doing what I'm doing, could you ask a question? That'll help me see that I need to take more time on a topic.</p>
