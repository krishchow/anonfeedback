[quote]Correct me if I am wrong, but why didnt you do any file to file or dir to dir tests? From my results all I saw was dir to dir. I did extremely bad on it but I understood the assignment it was just a matter of doing it and completing it. I thought we were getting marked on if we understood the material and what not which if you look at my code you can easily tell I am well aware of how everything works. Anyways, have a good day.[/quote]

<p>\n\nYes, we only did directory to directory. There were some edge cases on file to file (does the destination have the same name as the src? do you check if the destination is a directory before creating the file?) that meant that people generally did worse on file to file than directory to directory, so we used the latter as our base case.</p>
