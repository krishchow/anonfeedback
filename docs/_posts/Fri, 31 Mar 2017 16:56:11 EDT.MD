[quote]Hello Professor,
<!-- more -->
<p>\nSince you are pulling this tomorrow (Saturday) night, is it true that we can submit it tomorrow if need be? \n     Thanks [/quote]\n\n[quote]"However, I think it highly unlikely that we will be pulling submissions for autotesting until Saturday night, 10 p.m."\n\nJust to clarify, this means we technically have till Saturday to finish our assignment? I'm slightly confused by the wording. [/quote]\n\nWe won't be pulling assignments for automarking until Saturday night.</p>
