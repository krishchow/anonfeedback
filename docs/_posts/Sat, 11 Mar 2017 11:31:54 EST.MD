[quote]is there a pcrs video for setitimer? Very confused on how to use it. Could you perhaps provide an example on the discussion board or something?[/quote]\n\nNo, there isn't a video for setitimer.  \n\n[code]  struct itimerval value;\n  value.it_interval.tv_sec = 0;\n  value.it_interval.tv_usec = 0;\n  value.it_value.tv_sec = seconds;\n  value.it_value.tv_usec = 0;\n  setitimer(ITIMER_..., &value, NULL);[/code]\n\nThe example above assumes that [i]seconds[/i] is an [i]int[/i] holding the number of seconds until the alarm runs. [i]ITIMER_...[/i] isn't a real value. You need to choose between [i]ITIMER_REAL[/i], [i]ITIMER_VIRTUAL[/i], and [i]ITIMER_PROF[/i], each of which measure slightly different types of time (real time, execution time as the user process, and time spent executing the user process or as the OS doing work on behalf of the user process).\n\nIn general, could you please ask content-related questions on the board? When I'm short on time, my priorities are (1) discussion board, (2) email, and then (3) anonymous feedback -- so I don't see anonymous feedback until far later than the board.
