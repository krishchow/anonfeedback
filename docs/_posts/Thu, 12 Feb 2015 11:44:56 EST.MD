[quote=Anonymous]Are you a tenured professor or are you a lecturer? Reason i am asking is if the strike happens, are you continuing working or no? What does this mean for 258?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI'm a Senior Lecturer. I'm faculty, like those with professorial ranks, and while I don't have tenure, I'm permanent. I'll be here regardless of whether teaching assistants strike or not.</p>
