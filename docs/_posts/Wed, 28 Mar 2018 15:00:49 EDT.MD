[quote]You said "for something that's worth less than one percent"\n\nlabs are %20. 20/10labs = 2%. It is small, but it's certainly not < 1%[/quote]\n\nThat's true. I didn't look it up, and I confused it with the 209 labs.  My point stands, though: I got 4 messages about a tiny detail in the marking scheme worth less than 2% (unless you completely missed a lab and got a zero on it). I wish you would spend your energy and thought on more useful things.
