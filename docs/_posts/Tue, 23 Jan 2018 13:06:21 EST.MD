<p>\n\nThis is a tricky one for me, because I rely on your questions and your responses during activities to help me gauge whether the class if following. I'll do my best to try to get a sense of whether you're following, but I rely on you to ask questions (either by raising your hand or flagging me to come over during an activity) to help me understand that you need help. If the feedback I'm getting is only people nodding at the front, then I'll keep going -- could you help me out next class by letting me know when something is still foggy?</p>
