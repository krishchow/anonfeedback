[quote]If you want a higher class average, you should teach like Alvaro Nosedal-Sanchez. [/quote]\n\nI've never had the chance to observe Prof Nosedal-Sanchez teaching. I'd like to, at some point.  \n\nHowever, I think you and I have different perspectives. You're very clearly interested in marks, and I understand that's important to you. Employers pay attention to it. Grad school will require it. You've been graded for years. On the other hand, I really couldn't care less about  grades. I wish I didn't have to assign them, because they just get in the way of what I think is important: the material.\n\nInstead, I want to provide you with a series of experiences that help you understand what it means to be a system developer. I have a set of outcomes that I wish every student in 209 could demonstrate by the end of the course:\n\n1. Displaying an understanding of the underlying memory and process models.\n\n2. Adhering to desirable behaviours and professional standards in systems programming: checking errors, obtaining information from man pages, using appropriate tools (like version control and gdb).\n\n3. Effectively writing code that requires familiarity with a service provided by the OS, whether that service is the file system or the network.
