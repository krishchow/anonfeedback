[quote=Anonymous]I found the quiz we wrote this Monday too hard.[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nA reminder:\n1. In general, the question about the material from the previous week is drawn from the exercises.\n2. The question about the new material is drawn from a question in the reading guide.\n\nIn particular, last weekâ€™s questions were drawn directly from exercise 5.8: "Design the following comparators for 32-bit numbers. Sketch the schematics" and from the reading guide, "... the processor is split into a datapath and a control path. Be sure you understand what the purpose of each is ..."\n\nThis may come across as snarky. If so, I apologize. However, the questions on most of the quizzes have been [i]given to you beforehand[/i]. In particular, if this week's quiz was too hard, then you're not making effective use of the study aids being provided.</p>
