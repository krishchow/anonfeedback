[quote]I can see you're getting a lot of hate for the workload in 209, I wanted to remind you that there are at least a few of us who absolutely enjoyed this class and thought the expectations were perfectly reasonable.

<p>\n\nOut of all the CS courses I've taken so far 209 has been my favourite, and I can't really pinpoint why. I think the assignments were a great way to introduce to us how we're expected to find solutions to programming problems in the real world and I'm glad it wasn't done in groups, they were definitely my favourite part of the course. The labs/PCRS forced us to get at least some sort of understanding of the concepts each week and the midterm was a reminder that we're all a bit too dependent on copying and pasting code.\n\nWith all that said I know I won't be getting anywhere near a 4.0 but I don't care, this course has taught me a lot and that's all that matters.\n\nThank you for a great semester and good luck with the endless remark requests (I'll be sending mine shortly).[/quote]\n\nThanks for the buoying note.  There are definitely a few things I'd like to change -- both in content and structure -- next year, as well as getting a better handle on the size of the course, but I'm glad it worked well enough for you.</p>
