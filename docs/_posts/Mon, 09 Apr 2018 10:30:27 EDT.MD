[quote]when can we expect the rest of our marks back? (lab, pcrs, a2, a3...).[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nLabs are out. A3 and A4 will probably go out tomorrow. I'm holding them until after the exam, partly because I'm still sorting through email and partly to keep people from stressing about a potential mistake in how A3/A4 was tested right before the exam.</p>
