[quote]Week 3 PCRS, Arrays is kinda unclear for part 3.
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nYou ask, Write a void function that takes an integer array and its size as input and reverses the elements in the array.\n\nHowever this is completely different from what you actually want. You want each pair of elements in an array to switch places with each other (that is in an array "a" and some index "i", you want a[i] = a[i+1] and a[i+1] = a[i-1]).\n\nI feel that this should be updated to reflect this.[/quote]\n\nNo, that problem isn't asking you to swap adjoining pairs.  It's asking for the elements in the array to be reversed.</p>
