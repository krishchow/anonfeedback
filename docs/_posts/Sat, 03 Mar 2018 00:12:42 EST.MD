[quote]Just some feedback about Lab 7. 
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\n1) #include <sys/wait.h>\nwas not included in parentcreates.c\n\n2) A large cause of frustration for me was thinking that the process which is running the program in the first place is included in the ascii diagrams. I was trying forever to figure out why my processes weren't lining up with the examples. Turns out I was just including the extra process I shouldn't have. \n\nIt would've been really helpful if it was written somewhere to not include it or maybe it's just me. I spent hours trying to figure out why I had an "extra process". Pretty stupid in retrospect but thought I'd mention it. \n\n-student who took way too long on the lab [/quote]\n\nThank you! I added your comments to the file to review before labs are posted next year.</p>
