[quote]PCRS is extremely boring and never teaches me anything well. Please change it. It's such an extremely outdated and lazy way of teaching complex topics. Also, the readings are ridiculously hard to follow. This course should assume no one has ever done any of this command line and shell coding stuff before, yet the readings carry on like I know what I'm doing already.[/quote]

<p>\n\nI’m sorry you’re finding it boring. However, without evidence of something to try to do that's better, it's not going to change. I'm basing my thoughts on the 209 downtown section, where they've used the inverted (videos before lecture hosted in PCRS, activities in lecture and lab) format for a year longer than at UTM. We’ve seen evidence that the approach is working better than what we did before, which is why we continue to use it: \n\n1. CSC369 used to run an “assignment 0” to get people up to speed on C, and we’ve found we no longer need it. \n2. Performance on a quiz about pointers at the end of 209 has improved relative to performance on the quiz in earlier years.\n\nThe course (and PCRS) can certainly be improved, but based on the evidence we have, the inverted course is an improvement. If you'd like to talk about what would work better for you, I’d love to talk to you in person, if you’re comfortable doing so.</p>
