[quote]I was wondering, since the average for a4 is a bit low, would you ever consider taking the weight of the assignment and distributing part of it somewhere else, possibly exam or the lab, specifically w11 (since it related to a4)? Would you ever consider something like that? This is completely out of curiosity. I understand once the distribution on the syllabus have been set, its difficult to change them.[/quote]\n\nNot after the fact, no. I have, in the past, asked the class if they'd be willing to push some of the weight of a midterm that didn't go well onto the final exam. I wouldn't push the weight to something else that has already been submitted; that would just inflate marks, instead of giving students an incentive to put in more effort.
