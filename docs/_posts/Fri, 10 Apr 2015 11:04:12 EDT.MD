[quote=Anonymous]Just got this question in mind. Do professors have any stake in success or failure of a student in a course?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThere's an emotional investment: no one likes to see someone fail, and it's harder the better you know a student. But in terms of some compelling interest -- like being evaluated on the performance of a student -- no, I don't think we have a stake in any [i]individual's[/i] performance [i]in a course[/i].  \n\nWe often do have a significant stake in an individual's success or failure [i]outside of a course[/i]. If, for example, I work with a student extensively, then their success or failure is partially a reflection on me. This situation is most obvious in graduate studies. (Faculty are often judged on the success of their Ph.D. students.) However, it also applies to reference letters: if I write someone a strong reference letter, then the student's success or failure in that opportunity will make it more or less likely for others to believe my references. \n\nWe also have a compelling interest if you consider [i]everyone in the course in aggregate[/i]. A faculty's job performance is partially assessed on his/her ability to deliver successful learning opportunities. If an entire class of students were to succeed or fail in some measurable way, then that faculty member's standing would be affected.</p>
