[quote]What is the best way to prepare for the midterm? Also, can you post last years midterm? [/quote]

<p>\n\nIn my opinion, you've been doing it: complete the labs, complete the worksheets from class, work on the assignment. I would revisit some of the labs and worksheets, focusing on those you found difficult or that you are unsure you can complete when you re-read the instructions.  \n\nI'll post a midterm from last year at the end of reading week, so we can discuss it in the first class after reading week.</p>
