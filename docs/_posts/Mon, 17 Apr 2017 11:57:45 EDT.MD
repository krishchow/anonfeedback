[quote]How many people are you willing to accept into the major and specialist this year? [/quote]\n\nWe have ~125 specialist slots. Majors require half as many courses, so we can accept about 2 majors for every specialist.\n\nEdit: I should note that this number could change if we get an especially large number of minor registrations. Minor students take almost as many courses as majors, so we have to decrease the number of specialist slots if there are larger than expected number of students in the minor.
