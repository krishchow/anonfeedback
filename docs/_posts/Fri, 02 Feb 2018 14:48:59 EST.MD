[quote]Hey! So far 258 has been great, but I do want to say that this weeks lecture (FSMs) was probably the weakest. It might be an issue on my part, but despite doing the readings and following example, it was hard to attempt the practice questions. Even after the lecture, I felt as if I was left with more questions. The examples were hard to follow along, maybe moving a bit too quick is why. The issue wasn't the diagrams, it was the tables that were really difficult to understand. Other than that, 258 has been going great![/quote]

<p>\n\nThanks for the feedback. As we start looking at circuits to analyze (next week), I'll look for opportunities to review state encoding and table entry.</p>
