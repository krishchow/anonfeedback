[quote]Professor Petersen in the MCSS info session you mentioned that POSt will be around 2.8 cGPA for CS, did you mean that requirement for upper years or for first years ?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIn the info session, I was letting the attendees know that 3.0 was an upper limit and that I didn't think the requirement would be set at that limit. 2.8 seemed more reasonable -- though I hadn't yet consulted with the faculty, so I can't tell you, for certain, what the requirement will be or who it will apply to.</p>
