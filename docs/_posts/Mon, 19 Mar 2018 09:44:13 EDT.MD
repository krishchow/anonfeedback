[quote]"Where I get annoyed" <-- what else annoys you?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\n... in CS, or in general?  \n\nI get unjustifiably annoyed at words people choose to use, because I believe their definition and actual usage differ. (Yes, that makes me a genuine pedant. My father is an English professor. It's inherited.) You've heard me rant about the word "fair" in a previous post. "Clarify" also makes me shake my head, because it suggests a shift in agency and responsibility.</p>
