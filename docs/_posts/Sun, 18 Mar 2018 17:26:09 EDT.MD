[quote]The A3 assingnment handout is not detailed as the previous two handouts, could assignmnet 4â€™s handout be like the first two. There is just too much confusion with it, what functions should do, what the general idea of what pfact should do. I feel like im not doing this right sometimes.[/quote]

<p>\n\nHard to say. I think I've written A4 more like A3; that is, I'm asking you to figure out more about the syscalls to determine what the right design is.  However, there are a few things that had to be nailed down in the A4 handout, so you might find it more descriptive than A3.</p>
