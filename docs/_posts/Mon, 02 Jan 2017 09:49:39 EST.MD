[quote]I was wondering if there will be another class opening for csc148? I am still currently on the waitlist. Also is it a good idea to attend class while on the wait list? Thank you.[/quote]

<p>pid\n\nNo, there won't be another lecture section opening. I believe they'll be adding some slots to the existing lectures. However, since the campus has been closed for the past two weeks, nothing has changed since right before the holidays. I'd expect to see some changes in the next day or so.\n\nIn the meantime, yes, I'd attend the lecture if you're on the waitlist.</p>
