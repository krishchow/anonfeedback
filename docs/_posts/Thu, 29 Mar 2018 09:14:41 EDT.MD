[quote]When will all the marks for the quizzes be on portal?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI have most of the w8 and w9 quiz marks. (One TA is swamped, so he's a bit behind.) I'm starting to get w10 quiz marks (last week). \n\nI expect I'll have most of the marks posted by the end of next week, but it could be the second week of April before w11 marks are posted.</p>
