<p>\n\nAlso, don't be upset. That guy ...[/quote]\n\nNo. I've censored posts sometimes, and I'll simply snip away bits of posts if I feel like someone is sending me things just to see if I'll post them or if they're being mean to someone other than me (like your post). I'm not a robot, and I'll use common sense.</p>
