[quote]Will you post the prototype and cover sheet before the exam?[/quote]\n\n[quote]I get that scripting will not be asked on the exam but commands like moving directories and ls and stuff will be, however I what about shell programming. Would you expect us to know stuff like [ -e $FILE] and many of these ideas taught in week 11 pcrs.[/quote]\n\nErrrr ... sorry, no. \n\nFor future courses, it's worth noting that I answer anonymous feedback when I have time, which means that if requests or questions, you're better off posting them on the discussion board. I'll check the board a couple times a day; anonymous feedback might be held a few days or even a week.
