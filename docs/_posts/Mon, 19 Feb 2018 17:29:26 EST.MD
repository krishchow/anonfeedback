[quote]I think the reason you should give some basic test cases is so that we can verify that our code works, and so that we wont lose all our marks just because we slightly misunderstood the requirements. It really feels bad when I completed the difficult part of the assignment but did not get any marks for it because I printed an extra /n or had an extra space etc[/quote]

<p>\n\nI get that, but I think that info is already provided. For A2, we gave you a tests directory and [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~209/assignments/a2/example_output.txt]the output of our print function when run on that directory[/url].</p>
