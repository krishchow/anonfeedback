[quote]Error Message popout: Sorry, there was a problem with visualization: The code you have tried to visualize is not handled yet
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nwhen I try to trace this in C visualizer \n\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {\n    char **last_names;\n    last_names = malloc(sizeof(char*) * 4);\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++){\n        last_names[i] = malloc(sizeof(char)*20);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n[/quote]\n\nYes, dynamic memory is not yet implemented accurately in the visualizer, so it's disabled.</p>
