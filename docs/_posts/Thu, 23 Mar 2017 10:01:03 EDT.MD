[quote]If we did not do well on the midterm, what tips do you have for preparing/studying for the exam?[/quote]\n\nDo the assignments and then review them, to make sure you understand not only what code you wrote but [i]why[/i] you wrote that code.  (What does it do? How does it work?)  When you're reviewing for the exam, review the labs and the weekly assignments, asking the same questions.  PCRS questions are generally lower level, so they probably aren't worth reviewing.\n\nThen, do a past exam. Do it honestly. Work on paper, don't use google. Give yourself the time allotted. I'll post a recent exam written by Michelle, since there are not recent exams written by me. In general, I'm more interested in how things work and why than I am in your ability to write C code, though asking you to write a bit of code can reveal what you understand about a particular topic.
