[quote]I'm just curious as to how long would it take you (with the knowledge you have now) to complete assignment 2? I'm assuming half an hours max? Also how long do you expect this assignment would take students to complete?[/quote]\n\nHalf an hour to get something working. An extra hour to get something fully tested and working on all the edge cases.  For a student? It'll vary a great deal depending on how comfortable they are with trees (from 148), dynamic memory (from the labs), and most importantly, debugging (from 108 and the gdb lab). So, maybe 10-20 hours over 2 weeks, depending on how much backtracking is necessary.
