[quote]My program doesn't work. I literally dropped this course because of how bad I did and somehow I get over 30/40 ??? LITERALLY, my program does not work. At the last minute before the due date, I hard coded it to print the first two lines.

<p>\n\nI think the testing methodology is flawed here. Lots of people reporting similar results. friends who claimed to have the assignment done getting marks in the 60s. Friends who barely knew what they were doing got 90s...\n\nDoesn't matter to me since I dropped out but something is seriously up. [/quote]\n\nYes, I've been working on a bug for the past couple hours, and marks are, unfortunately for some people, going to be updated soon.\n\nThat being said:\n1) Marks are high because we weighed the minimally recursive cases heavily. The tests with subdirectories and multiple files per subdirectory are worth less.\n2) A student who used a more complex list may have lost points because we were unable to automatically verify the names or hashes in their nodes, and they'll do better after they ask us to look at it manually.</p>
