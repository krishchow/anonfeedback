[quote]Just wondering whether or not you have root access to all our repositories, i.e. it doesn't matter what our permissions are set to, you'll be able to access them anyway. I ask because sometimes I find my permissions are set to something like -rw-r--r-- for certain files (maybe an issue with SSHing from home), which means they're missing execution permissions. I know how to use chmod, but in case I miss something by accident, is that an automatic 0 for lab marks?[/quote]

<p>\n\nI don't have root access to any repositories, but the way git works, when you clone something, you own the files that are created. \n\nThe only things that need execute permissions are directories and executables. We'll create your executables, so I don't anticipate any permission problems.</p>
