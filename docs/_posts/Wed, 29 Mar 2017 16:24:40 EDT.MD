<p>\nOkay, now that we're at the end, you should tell us the truth. What's the real reason to there being two PCRS ladies?\n\nAre they actually the same lady? Aliens? A power struggle over who should do the PCRS videos? Robots where one malfunctioned for a bit so a replacement was brought in for a couple videos??!? What is the truth?!?![/quote]\n\n[url=https://michellecraig.github.io/]The professor in most of the videos is Michelle Craig.[/url] The professor in [url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid/[/url]some of the later, more system-oriented videos is Karen Reid.[/url]\n\nWhen we first started creating material for this course, Michelle drew the short straw and was made the "face" of all of the videos. Then, we used the material for a year (on the StG campus). After that year, we created more videos to fill in gaps identified in the first run of the course (so now, we need to create some socket videos ...), and Karen did the production on those.\n\nThough ... "power-crazy robots" is a way cooler answer.</p>
