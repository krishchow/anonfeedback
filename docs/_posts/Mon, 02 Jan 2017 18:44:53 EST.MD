[quote]I would like recommend adding a tab or links in the course website as to how to install the soft wares required in the course, such as how to set up Unix/Linux, C, and/or virtual machine for windows computers. It would help us out in finding the proper way to install these soft wares rather than potentially having trouble later in the semester when things are due.[/quote]

<p>\n\nSorry, no. There are just too many decisions to make that depend on your personal situation. There's no one-size fits all set of instructions for setting up an operating system. For example, you'll need to answer, for yourself, "what flavour of linux?" and "dual boot or virtual machine?" Then, setting up C and other tools depends on those decisions. You'll need to use your favorite search engine to find information to make those decisions and to get instructions for your particular situation. \n\nIf you're not comfortable setting up a linux environment on your own machine -- and this is a perfectly valid choice, given the time investment required -- then you can use the environment we provide in the labs. The simplest solution which will allow you to work off-campus is to use [i]ssh[/i] to log into a lab machine or server remotely.</p>
