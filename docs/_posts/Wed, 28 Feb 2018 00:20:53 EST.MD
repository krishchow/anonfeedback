[quote]It took me 2 full days to complete the week 6 lab and a LOT of outside help. Should I be concerned? What should I do if this is a bad thing?[/quote]

<p>\n\nThe Makefile lab? I hope you're being hyperbolic; two full days is a huge amount of time.  If you're not exaggerating, then yes, I would be concerned, but I'd need to know more about what kept you from being successful to be able to tell you what you might try. Come talk to me.</p>
