[quote]Will you make the exam harder than previous years since we didnâ€™t have a midterm? [/quote]

<p>\n\nI base assessments based on desired outcomes. When I teach a course, I define (if the department has not already) a set of measurable actions that students should be able to demonstrate after the course. Those actions should be related to key material in the course, and I should be able to show them to someone else in the department and have them say, "That makes sense. It's what we expect students to know."  Then, I build the exam off of those outcomes.</p>
