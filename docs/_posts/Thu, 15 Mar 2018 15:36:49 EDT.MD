[quote]I was reading other anonymous feedback responses by you on other course sites on the discussion board and was wondering if you give different responses based on the year you are teaching. Will the response change if it was CSC108? Or do you try to keep all responses similar? [/quote]

<p>\n\n... I'm not sure. In most cases, the responses are probably pretty similar.  However, there are some questions that probably deserve a different response, based on the perspective of the intended audience, so I might give a more complete or nuanced response to one course than I might give in another. In other cases, the question might be framed in a different context, so my response may differ because of the context. (I would answer, "Why is this course so much work???" differently for different courses.)</p>
