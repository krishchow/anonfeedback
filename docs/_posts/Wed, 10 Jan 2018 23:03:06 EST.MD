[quote]Can you hold extra office hrs on friday pls?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nOi. I might be in a position where I have to do the opposite. There's a faculty hiring meeting being scheduled. It would be downtown, and one possible time is mid-day Friday. If that meeting gets scheduled there, I'd need to cancel my late afternoon office hours.  \n\nThat being said: assuming I or Prof. Dema could hold extra office hours, when would it be useful to do so?</p>
