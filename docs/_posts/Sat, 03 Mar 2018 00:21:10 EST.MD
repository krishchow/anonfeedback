[quote]Is it possible to get a bit more than two weeks to complete A3?[/quote]\n\nSorry, but no. The A3 deadline has already been pushed back a bit, because of the midterms this week and next, and that has pushed A4 to the last possible day. If A3 were pushed any further back, you'd have less than two weeks to get A4 done, and that assignment deserves more time.
