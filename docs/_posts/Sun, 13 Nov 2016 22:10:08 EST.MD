[quote]what's the point of a code review?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIn a professional setting, a code review is a useful way to verify the correctness of a piece of code. You get multiple sets of eyes on a specification and the code that implements it to make sure that the specification is correct and that the code implements it appropriately.\n\nIn our setting, the goal is to hear multiple perspectives on code that should be familiar. I'm hoping that you see that there are multiple correct ways to implement a function, that reasonable programmers can disagree about what they prefer, and that there are some obvious mistakes in your coding style that you can fix for the next assignment.</p>
