[quote]Why so many readings? We have 209 a2 due and 258 lab and on top a quiz?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIt doesn't feel, to me, like this week is any longer than past weeks ... ? The logic behind prefix adders is tricky, but most of the material this week is an extension of two weeks ago: it's the creation of devices using other high-level devices.  \n\nBeyond that: one course doesn't pause just because another course has an assignment due. You received the deadlines at the beginning of the term. If there's a rough week coming up, let us know, and we can try to flex some things (as we did in 209 and with this week's 258 lab).</p>
