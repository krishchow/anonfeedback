[quote]Hi! So what is the estimated time of posting the marks right now? \nSorry for asking same question many times :/[/quote]\n\nProf. Rosenbloom and I decided we're both tired of grading, so we're planning a weekend trip to New York City to see some shows. We'll be back late next week and will start grading again. So ... 2 or 3 weeks?\n\nIf you don't believe that, then ...\n\nI finished marking and submitted grades this evening. However, Prof. Zingaro, who approves CSC marks, says that the distribution has too many A's and B's compared to CSC263 and has asked me to review the exam marking to make sure the course average is lower. ([url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~148/feedback.shtml]Feel free to send him feedback about that here.[/url]) So ... depending on how long it takes us to remark exams, 2 or 3 weeks?\n\nIf you don't believe that, then ...\n\nIt looks like there are about 15 A4 remarks left. After that, I'll need to calculate term marks, enter adjustments due to accommodations, review any exams of students with failing marks, and then submit marks. After submission, it'll take a day or so for marks to be approved (unless, well, see above). So ... 3 days?
