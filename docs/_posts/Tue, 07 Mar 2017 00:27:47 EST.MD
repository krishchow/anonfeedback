[quote]What are you going to do about the fake doctors' notes on the midterm?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThat's a pretty serious charge. If you have evidence to support it, I'd appreciate seeing it.\n\nProf. Zingaro and I aren't unaware of the potential that a request for accommodation (for a midterm or assignment) could be false. There are, after all, unexplained increases in the incidence of the flu, food poisoning, and migraines whenever multiple assessments are due at the same time and whenever a test or exam is viewed as being particularly tough. \n\nHowever, to be fair to students who do encounter an emergency of some sort, we need to treat the requests we receive in good faith. As a matter of course, we assume that the requests we receive are legitimate. Then, we do our due diligence. I require that absences be declared on Acorn, I often ask the department's undergraduate counselor to spot-check medical notes by calling clinics, and this time, we'll cross-reference to make sure that students who missed one test actually missed both.</p>
