[quote]I personally feel, along with a few other students that the quizzes for 258 are extremely unfair especially for tutorial sections that take place in the afternoon on Wednesday's. A lot of students in earlier sections share the quiz question with students who have the tutorial later in the evening. And it turns out that the quiz questions for the 5-7 and the 7-9 sections are extremely similar (or in terms of concept covered by the quiz questions) to the ones earlier on wednesday. I appreciate that the quiz questions are different on Thursday's but is it possible to change up the questions for later sections as well?[/quote]\n\nThat's disappointing but not too surprising. Thank you for letting me know.  \n\nI would not trust that quizzes will retain the same format (the TAs are given a few choices as to which quiz they wish to use), but frankly, all of the quiz questions are derived from the recommended exercises. There are not that many questions to be asked in a given week.\n\nIn any case, I am monitoring average quiz marks in sections, and as necessary, I'll make adjustments across lab sections.
