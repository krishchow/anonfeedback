[quote]Are there any other resources we can use other than the textbook? Having videos like PCRS would be helpful. [/quote]

<p>\n\nThe resource I'm recommending -- and spending time vetting -- is the textbook. There's an internet full of other resources, if you feel the need for additional exercises or a different perspective on a topic, but just because of the time required to review material, I'm not recommending any particular one. If you've found a resource you think is useful and want to share (or if you want me to quickly check it to see if it seems legitimate), please send it to me.</p>
