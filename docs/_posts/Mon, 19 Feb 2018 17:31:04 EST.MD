[quote]Not sure if you are familiar with Logisim, but it is a very basic program that has really helped me out in understanding/designing digital circuits. I'm sure it is nowhere near as powerful as Quartus but it is free and much easier to use. At the very least it may be worth mentioning to students to give them an opportunity to practice building circuits at home without worrying about the hefty installation process associated with Quartus.

<p>\n\nI discovered it a couple weeks ago and used it to model the circuits I was designing before the lab and it has been a great way for me to focus on understanding the course concepts while not stumbling around the Quartus interface.\n\nMight be worth taking a look into if you have not seen it before.\n\nhttp://www.cburch.com/logisim/[/quote]\n\nYes, I've seen it. One of the TAs really likes it; thanks for the additional endorsement.</p>
