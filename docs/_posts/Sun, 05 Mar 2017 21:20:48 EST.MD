[quote]Hello,\nI know I did really poorly on the midterm. I feel really discouraged and scared and anxious afterwards. I know this is irrational and the course will soon be over but I'm afraid I won't be able to 'get it'.\n\nI do all the prep and labs every week and have not many issues with them. But why did that midterm give me so much grief? How do I pick myself up?\n\nI can't execute what is being asked. How can I learn better?\n[/quote]\n\nI'm sorry to hear the midterm didn't go well.\n\nI don't think I can answer this question anonymously. It's going to take a conversation, so you'll have to come see me.
