[quote]Is assingment 3 going to be harder than this assignment? The material for this assignment isn't hard, its just that the program has alot of things to think about and is a bit long.[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nMaybe? \n\nYes, the material is more challenging -- we'll be working with processes. However, a lot of the difficulty with A2 is that the material is new: dynamic memory is still difficult to work with, and you're having to be much more hands-on with error checking than you've had to be in previous courses (and with other languages you've used). That will get easier with practice, so in that sense, you may find A3 easier.\n\nA4, if history is any guide, will be significantly more difficult. Part of it is timing. You'll be very busy at the end of the term, when A4 is available. However, networking introduces a whole new set of error modes and makes testing very difficult.</p>
