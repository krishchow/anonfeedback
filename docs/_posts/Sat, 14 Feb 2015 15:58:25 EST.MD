[quote=Anonymous]Can you release a midterm review for us? What sections do we need to know up to? Also a breakdown i.e. how many marks/questions would be helpful! Thanks![/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nYes, I will, but I'll need to finish the midterm first. I'll try to get a breakdown posted by the end of Reading Week.\n\nThe material covered will extend up to (and include) the week 7 material. The reading guides, taken together, are a good guide. In addition to the exercises and questions listed in the guides, please review the designs you implemented in lab.</p>
