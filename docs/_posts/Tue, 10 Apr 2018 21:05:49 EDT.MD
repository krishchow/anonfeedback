[quote]The math profs said that they have to mark our exams. Is there any reason why the rules are different for math and cs profs?[/quote]\n\n[quote=A math prof]No idea. I wish I knew.[/quote]\n\n[quote=A math prof]I wasn't aware that other disciplines played by different rules in this regard[/quote]\n\nI'm not aware of any university rule that mandates that faculty grade all of their exams. I heard a rumor, when I started, that classes below a certain size were to be marked by instructors, but I never found any policy to back up the rumor and that doesn't explain math profs marking calculus. \n\nOn the other hand, there is some evidence that faculty are [i]not[/i] required to do all of the exam marking. There is a policy, at the faculty level, that instructors must [i]review[/i] the exam of any student who is failing the course, and the wording of that policy assumes that TAs or others will be doing at least some of the marking. \n\n As a result, I think that math profs being required to mark their exams is a departmental norm, rather than policy.
