[quote]Are you satisfied with the retention rate of CSC209 this year compared to last year?[/quote]\n\nIt's still high: about a 25% drop, compared to the first day of class, with a day left to LWD. For comparison, I normally expect 20% in a third year course.\n\nThat suggests a few changes have worked: adding a valgrind lab to help with memory, emphasizing debugging with gdb, getting marks back faster (errr ... kind of ...). There's more to do, though. From what I've seen, students are struggling with starting assignments, and they're having trouble using structures and ideas from earlier courses.
