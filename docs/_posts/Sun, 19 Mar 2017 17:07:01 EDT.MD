[quote]Do you know what the mode of the midterm was? The average was 50, but was it because there was a lot of 0s and 100s? or were people generally scoring 50?

<p>\n\njust curious![/quote]\n\nThe mode doesn't really indicate central tendency. The mode turned out to be 5.5 (a 39%!), but that just tells us that there is a group of people who scored fairly low. There are other notable peaks at 4 and 7.5. \n\nThe distribution looks, to me, to be fairly normal, but it's got a fairly wide "peak" between 40% and 60%.</p>
