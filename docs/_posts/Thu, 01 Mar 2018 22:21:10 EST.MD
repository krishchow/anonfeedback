[quote]Can UofT advertise the requirements and definition of POSt better to high school students so that they know they aren't in their program until second year. UTM took students from the low 80s from Ontario for the 2017-18 CS session and let me tell you that low 80s is nothing, a person with low 80s generally can't get the POSt requirements for CS. Yes of course a few of them can still make POSt but if it was better advertised the people on the lower end of the high school average requirement would consider other offers that they may have. Don't want this to be a rant but I really feel like UofT can do a much better job advertising POSt which will not shatter hopes and dreams and won't provide unexpected levels of stress[/quote]
