[quote]Hey professor Petersen, I was talking to a student about POSt applications and they said that if I was to take two 3rd year CS courses over the summer to complete the minor, I could be considered using the 3rd year AGPA policy at the end of the summer session. Is this accurate?[/quote]\n\n[url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=6353]Take a look at this thread.[/url] There's nothing there about needing to be a third year student;you just have to complete a specific amount of courses.
