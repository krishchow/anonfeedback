[quote]I don't find the pcrs helpful to prepare me for the lecture (and I suppose many students think the same). CSC108 pcrs was great, it made us practice basic coding skills and actually prepare for lecture. 209 pcrs, on the other hand, is not interactive at all. We just end up watching some boring and vague videos. Learning through pcrs is far less helpful than attending lecture in my opinion. I wonder if you think increasing the lecture hours would help for next years?[/quote]

<p>\n\nI'm sorry you're not finding it helpful. I do think it's less effective than it is in 108, but I'm still getting more positive feedback about it than negative. I think it would benefit from having more coding exercises early, while we're working on coding, and downtown, they're experimenting with adding short answer questions to evaluate some of the later systems work. I haven't bought into that yet, as last year's experiment with short answer had a negative affect, but I could imagine introducing it next year.\n\nAdding extra lecture hours is a non-starter. Changing the hours (and requirements) for a course is a complex process that, ultimately, requires approval from multiple levels of campus committees, and we don't really have a case for requesting an increase for 209.</p>
