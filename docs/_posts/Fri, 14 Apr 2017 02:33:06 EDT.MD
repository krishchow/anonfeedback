[quote]You didn't even test edge cases? We all wasted so much time. I'd ask for a remark but I couldn't care less. I hope CSC369 isn't going to be this much of a s**t-show[/quote]\n\nI tested more edge cases than we used to calculate the mark. I omitted tests that very few people passed, in an attempt to focus on the core functionality people wrote (and to reduce the anonymous feedback I get about the evil automarker ... mais c'est la vie). \n\nI'm sorry that you feel that you wasted your time writing that code since it didn't contribute to the final mark you earned. However, I expect that you already have a high mark on the assignment, and I hope that working through the edge cases gave you practice that will come in handy for the "shit show" that will be CSC369.
