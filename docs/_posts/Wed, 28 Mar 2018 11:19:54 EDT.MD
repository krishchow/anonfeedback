[quote]If a CS course has a prerequisite, i.e. CSC290, but we take an alternative course listed on the academic calendar, i.e. CCT110, can we enroll in said CS course without fear of being removed or do we need to fill out a waiver form for the alternative course first? Thank you!![/quote]

<p>\n\nCSC290 is usually waived automatically. Almost every other prerequisite is enforced. So, if you are missing 290, I'd just wait to see if you're kicked (and then fill out the prereq form if need be). For anything else, I'd fill in the waiver form first.</p>
