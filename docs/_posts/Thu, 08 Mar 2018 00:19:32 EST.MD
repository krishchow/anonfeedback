[quote]You should have some sort of platform where you just answer questions and/or talk about course-unrelated topics. Your replies to the questions about the field of CS, work ethic, and your journey to where you are now are all inspiring and fascinating. The answers to how you were in undergrad heavily demystify the idea of getting good at something we (at times) assume we can never master. It's refreshing and uplifting to hear firsthand that someone who is amazing at something was once not so amazing at it -- even though we all know this implicitly.[/quote]\n\nThat's very kind -- thank you -- and a good idea. I've made a note to see, as a sideproject, if it's feasible/interesting to scrape the anon feedback threads for a couple recent courses into a webpage. I suspect a lot of the messages will be boring the anyone who is not in the course, but it could be useful to have an archive for the messages that don't directly talk about the course.
