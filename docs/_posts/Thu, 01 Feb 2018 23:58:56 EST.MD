[quote]Can you please make the quizzes out of 6 or assign half marks? A tiny mistake that should count for half a mark or less turns a 3 to a 2. [/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nSome weeks, there are half marks available. Other weeks, there are not.  It depends on whether there is a clear, easily identifiable intermediate step that can be marked. However, in many weeks, the TAs are being asked to mark things like, "1 point for a correct truth table" and "1 point for extracting a correct equation from a k-map" -- what does a half mark truth table look like, or a half correct equation? Either the process used is correct, or it's not.</p>
