[quote]Hi Andrew, can I have you suggestion on what kinds of knowledge do we need if we want to find a internship?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThat really depends on the internship.  I would consider the question, "What ... do you need to find a job?" instead, since internships are just jobs where they are expecting the employee to come in with little direct experience. So, what field do you want to end up in, and what skills are required for those positions? An internship would require a demonstration of those skills -- or of related work that might translate. For example, if you're interested in doing mobile development, I'd just jump in and build demo projects in a few platforms, so you can speak confidently about development for mobile devices.  You wouldn't be expected to have significant experience, but showing interest -- and at least knowing the lingo -- will get you part of the way.</p>
