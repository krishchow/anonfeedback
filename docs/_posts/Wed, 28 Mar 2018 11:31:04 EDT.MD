[quote]With all the post stuff going around, [... kind words ...]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIf possible could we get a full explanation of events that unfolded in making this POST being changed so suddenly, and without any real warning? \n\nAnd who or what caused this spiral of events.\nThe despair is being felt in 2nd and 3rd years hard with the sudden changes and path closures.\n [/quote]\n\nThanks for the motivating note.  \n\nNo, I'm not going to provide a timeline or explanation in writing. I'm happy to discuss the situation in person, if you have specific questions.  \n\n[quote]hey professor Petersen, I'm sure you're probably very upset and stressed with all this POSt stuff [... kind words ...][/quote]\n\nThank you!</p>
