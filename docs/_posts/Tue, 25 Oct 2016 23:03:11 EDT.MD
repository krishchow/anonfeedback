[quote]Would it be possible to create different fourms for each of the assignments on the Discussion Board?
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nWhen I go to the Discussion Board to look for questions about A2, I find myself looking through every page, making sure I didn&#x27;t miss anything.\nEven with the titles including A1 and A2, I feel as although it would be a bit more organized and would allow me to waste less time going through each and every page looking for what might not even be there.[/quote]\n\nI'll ask our sys admin if he can set up some more subforums. (I don't have the power.) \n\nIn the meantime: the posts are sorted by date. Once you hit the first A1 thread, you're not going to see any A2 threads below it.</p>
