[quote]Instead of posting quiz/lab marks like this:\n<snip>\nCan you instead post a Histograph? This way we can see where we are in the course relative to other students. The 2.03/2.02 quiz averages doesn't allow us to compare as much. Thank you  [/quote]\n\nSorry, no. Every request like this seems small, but collectively, they take up a lot of time (5 minutes per week is an hour), and I'm already behind this term. Until I catch up on marking, I need to say no to things that don't seem like they'll make a big impact. In this case, I'm not sure how a histograph would provide sufficient additional value to justify the time. It provides sufficient info to verify that the average for the course is where I promised it would be, and that means that, over multiple weeks, you can get a sense of whether you're ahead or behind.
