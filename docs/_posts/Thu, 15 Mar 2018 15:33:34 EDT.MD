[quote]Stephen Hawking died. One of the greatest minds in the world. Why is no one at UTM especially in MCS department paying tribute to him?!! He lived through a computer and that's how he did all of his research. At least acknowledge how Computers allowed for him to to grant his knowledge to the public and pass all the barriers he had in becoming successful!!![/quote]\n\nWell, I had a private moment of reflection, after which I watched the Stephen Hawking vs. Einstein ERB (Epic Rap Battles from History).\n\nMore seriously, I did note his passing, but I can't say that I thought it was a moment to commemorate from a CS perspective.
