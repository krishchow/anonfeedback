[quote]... I have come to the conclusion that CS professors are either on some kind of drugs that dull the pain, or have reached a level of enlightenment(not the desktop environment) that is very difficult to obtain, or store the frustration and spend hours at the shooting range after office hours. Whichever the case may be, I wish you good luck in the future.

<p>\n\nMay your temperatures be low and your compile times fast. \n\nP.S. I enjoyed the exam, only bad part about it was having to write on paper. \n[/quote]\n\nThanks! I'm glad you enjoyed the exam.  (For the record, I tend to cook and/or upgrade the house to "dull the pain." My family knows it's been a long day when I pull out the mixing bowls or the toolbox.)</p>
