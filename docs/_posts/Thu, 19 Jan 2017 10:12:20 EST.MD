[quote]I have heard a lot about CS education research going on an UTM, but I am not sure what the exact intention of it is. Is it simply to understand and improve the teaching of CS to humans, or is it to develop an understanding of how humans learn CS for applications in artificial intelligence? [/quote]

<p>\n\nThe former. [url=https://uoftcsed.github.io/pubs/]Here is a list of work that the group (across U of T) has done, if you're interested.[/url]\n\nDan and I are often looking for students to work on projects. If you're interested in getting into research and CS education work sounds intriguing, then look for an announcement about Research Opportunity Program (ROP) slots for 2017-18 in the next few weeks. You could also join the CS education reading group that is running at noon on Friday this term.</p>
