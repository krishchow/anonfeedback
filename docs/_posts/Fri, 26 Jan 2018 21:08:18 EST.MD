[quote]Labs are a bit too long[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIf you're talking about the week 3 lab (muxes), then you might want to spend extra time preparing for the next few labs. They get longer in the next few weeks, as you build larger structures on your way to a processor. You'll get better at working with the software, too, but you might want to do the labs partially ahead of time to make sure you finish.</p>
