[quote]<cursing snipped> dont extend deadlines after their posted. Its not fair to the students who actaully manage their time <snip>[/quote]\n\nFairness to all of the students -- including those who are nearly finished and those who are not available over reading week -- factored into our reasoning when we decided to remove the penalty for a resubmission. \n\nThis week is legitimately quite busy,  so it's not honest to characterize the students who asked for an extension as being lazy. Removing the penalty gives them the option to schedule work on early-week deadlines without impacting their 209 marks. At the same time, there's still an advantage to submitting a nearly complete assignment to the due date, since you'll get feedback and a second attempt to submit (without a penalty).
