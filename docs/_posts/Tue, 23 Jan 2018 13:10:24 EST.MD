[quote]Can you please go over multiplexers and mux for tomorrow's lecture (Tuesday)?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI wasn't planning on doing so, since muxes are the focus of  the lab. We'll look at an example of where a mux might be used, but if you have other questions, please raise them at the beginning of class (or as we talk about muxes).  \n\n[quote]Also, can you show us a detailed step by step guide on how to make a bigger multiplexer from many small basic muxes?[/quote]\n\nDefinitely no, not in class. Sorry! If we spend time on that, we won't be able to cover material on latches that I think the majority of the class is finding difficult. I recommend looking at figure 2.58 in the text for a hint about making a larger multiplexer from smaller ones. The same design scales up to 8-1 or even 16-1.</p>
