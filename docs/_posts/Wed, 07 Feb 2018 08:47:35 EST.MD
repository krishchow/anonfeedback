[quote]After reading the text for the week in advance, I feel that I do not have a clear understanding of what is happening. As I attempt the assigned questions, I have no idea on how to start them. The text is descriptive but the examples are not clear enough for me to follow along. In the lecture, the examples are done too quickly without any explanation. This often yields me to not understand how to correctly answer the questions and this causes me to do poorly on the quizzes. Is there a way to get more examples in the text or content? \nAlso, quiz solutions would be nice, so we can correct ourselves for the exam.[/quote]\n\nHmmm. This sounds like it's something we should talk about face-to-face.  If you genuinely don't have an idea of how to [i]start[/i] a question after viewing a related example, then there's an underlying issue (material from a past week? a misunderstanding about a term?) that's keeping you from making progress. Please try to come see me in the next week.
