[quote]can you upload practice questions for the midterm on PCRS like you did for 108 last year?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nI really don't think that would help. I mean, maybe ... but I think it would encourage you to spend time on the things that PCRS covers effectively (C syntax, mainly) and not on the things that it doesn't do well (bash, I/O, other syscalls). The latter (in particular, code that uses syscalls like the last few labs and the assignment) are the key elements in the course -- not C syntax.</p>
