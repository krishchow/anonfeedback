[quote]Will the exam be any harder than the quizzes? If we are doing well on the quizzes, should we be fine for the exam?[/quote]

<p>\n\nYou can take a look at past exams in the exam repository.  \n\nFor exams, I generally source some questions from the assigned exercises and reading guide questions (like the quizzes) and then add a few questions from lab. I feel more comfortable asking larger/longer questions, since you have more time to think and to work on them, so it's more difficult in that sense.  I also feel comfortable asking some integrative questions that connect topics.</p>
