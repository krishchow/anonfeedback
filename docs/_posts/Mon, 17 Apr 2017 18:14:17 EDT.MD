[quote]Hopefully I'm not wrong in asking this, but can you tell us how many people failed from the exam? As in, how many people got less than 40 on the exam? Would be great if it was 0 people. [/quote]

<p>\n\nI don't yet know how many people failed from the exam. (In other courses I've taught, almost anyone who scores below 40% is already failing.) However, there were some scores that were less than 40%. (The lowest score on the exam was a 1 out of 39.)</p>
