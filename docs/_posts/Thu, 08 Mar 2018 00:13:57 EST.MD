[quote]How many people have gotten 100% in the courses that you have taught so far and what is the highest number of people with a 100 in the course with the most 100s(csc108?).[/quote]\n\nI can't get you that answer. I don't think I even have course mark records from the first few years I taught anymore. Last term, in 108, there were ~5 marks at 99 or above.
