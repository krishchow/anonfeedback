[quote=Anonymous]Do UTM CS students get the pink hippo plushy when they graduate, or is it just UTSG CS students? If we don't, you should start something like that at UTM.[/quote]\n\n[quote=Anonymous]To add to the feedback I just sent, if we UTM CS students don't get the pink hippo, you should start giving out a pink deer. It would suit UTM's deer-like-spirit.[/quote]\n\nI do not believe there are any pink hippos associated with graduation from UTM CSC.\n\nI've forwarded your suggestion about the pink deer to Arnold Rosenbloom. I'd love to be in the room when he gets the email.
