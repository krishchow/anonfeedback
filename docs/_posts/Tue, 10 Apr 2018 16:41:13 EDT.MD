[quote]I just want to say that I really appreciated how balanced the exam felt. I think that it struck a fantastic balance between the finer details of the course and the core concepts that we used to write our assignments. I think that there was one too many coding questions, and that the marks for that question could be made up by including more of the memory model type questions (like the April 2017 exam), and maybe another short answer question related to signaling or sockets. All in all I feel like there shouldn't be any students who got caught off guard by the content of the exam.[/quote]\n\n3e was a long one. The other coding questions were relatively short. You might be right about midterm length, though. It looks like the last question (and 3e) were left blank at a higher rate than I expected.\n\nThe TAs marked fast today. We'll probably finish marking tomorrow and will get marks tallied Thursday. I'll leave the door open for remark requests through the end of the week and will get marks posted over the weekend.
