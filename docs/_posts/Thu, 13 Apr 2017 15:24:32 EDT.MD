[quote]When will we be able to see our exam mark?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nYou won't, from me.\n\nI don't [i]really[/i] understand why (see below for speculation), but I've been told never to post exam marks on blackboard. So while you can request a viewing of your exam from the office of the registrar, and while you should be able to calculate your final exam mark from your final score, I can't give you your exam mark.\n\nI think it's related to this line in the faculty procedures manual: "Under no circumstances may instructors release final marks to students before they have gone through this approval process and been posted on ROSI by the OFR." The final exam is the last possible chance to alter the marks distribution of the course, so if my marks are rejected (I've never heard of this happening ... ?), then I suppose I'd need to find a way to adjust the exam marks.</p>
