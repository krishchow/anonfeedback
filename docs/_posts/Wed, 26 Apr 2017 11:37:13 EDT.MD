[quote]If we do not get accepted into the CS Major/Specialist, would you recommend completely switching programs? To my knowledge a fair amount of companies will discriminate if you have a Minor in CS vs having a Major/Specialist. But that's just my speculation, I wish to know your thoughts.[/quote]\n\nIt really depends on your particular situation. If you don't get accepted in first year, I certainly recommend developing a backup plan, so you can graduate with an alternate (or second) major if necessary.  If you were not accepted after the third year, then it's time to [i]consider[/i] situations where you graduate with a CS minor.\n\nBut honestly: you just asked me, "If my car won't start, would you recommend buying a new car?" It depends. Is the engine or transmission broken, or did your car just run out of gas? [i]Anonymous feedback isn't a replacement for a conversation.[/i]
