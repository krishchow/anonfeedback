[quote]Just so you know some people are going to complain to the Dean about how slowly you're posting marks.[/quote]

<p>\n\nI appreciate the warning, and I am sorry that A2 marks have been delayed so long. I also agree that it's better to have marks out as early as possible, and I'll try to get marks out earlier next year.\n\nHowever, the requirement is for 15% of the marks to be returned by the last date to withdraw from the course without academic penalty. That was March 12, and we had returned A1 and the midterm by that date, so there are no grounds for a complaint to the department chair.</p>
