[quote]For the sanity of future students, please use a language other than python in the future(or allow importing of files for pcrs). My code works perfectly when running on my computers(tested on 2 different machines, running Gentoo linux v4.4.6 and Gentoo linux v4.8.4), however when I run it in pcrs, pcrs says that it has an indentation error. This would not be an issue for other languages(such as C++) that have their logic based completely on visible characters. [/quote]

<p>\n\nI'm sorry! That's a pain. \n\nThat being said: we're sticking with Python. There just so many advantages in the first few weeks (compared to say, "public static void main"). I'm sure there will be another language that comes along in the next few years, but for now, it's great to be using a language that provides scripting and science support without the cruft of the older languages like Java and C.</p>
