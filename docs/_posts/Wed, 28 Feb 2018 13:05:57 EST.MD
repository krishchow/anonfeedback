[quote]I got a 16/30 on A2, and all my cases worked perfectly fine before I handed them. I did the entire assignment through the lab computers. When I got my marks back. I got 0 on both of the files, and the /proc directory. I really don't understand how it is crashing, but when I run it, it works. Is there something I can do about this? Is there anyway I can get it looked by a TA for a manual remark?[/quote]

<p>\n\nThe TAs aren't remarking, but I am. If you send me an email, I'll take a look at it and send you a note about what I find.</p>
