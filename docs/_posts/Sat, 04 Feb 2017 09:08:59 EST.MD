[quote]This semester is going horribly for me so far. Can you please say something motivating?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nNext week is week 6 of 12. You're half done! (Is that motivating or de-motivating? I'm really bad at "motivating.")\n\nMore seriously: if you're struggling in this course, please drop by for office hours, send email to set up an appointment, or visit Andy Chow during TA office hours. So far, we've been preparing: learning C, getting comfortable with the shell, and figuring out a few tools (gcc, man). Things start to get interesting now that we're dealing with the memory model and are starting to think about how the operating system implements files and running programs.</p>
