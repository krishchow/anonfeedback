[quote]In lecture you mentioned the "master-slave" designation was inappropriate for the two D latches in a D flip-flop. Perhaps it could be better described as "writer-reader" instead? I know they technically both write and read depending on the CLK, but I think it's less offensive and better describes the roles of the latches.[/quote]

<p>\n\nThere have been a few attempts to remove "master-slave" from CS. Results have been mixed, but I think it'll all change eventually. "client-server" has been proposed as an alternative in some situations. "parent-child" and "controller-controllee" have also been used, but in the hardware domain, none of those alternatives are well-recognized. \n\nJust deciding to change the name of something doesn't work well: people won't understand. It'll take a specification being written that uses (and defines) the new terms or a widely-used manufacturer changing their terminology.</p>
