[quote]Why is STA256 required for computer science?[/quote]

<p>\n\nMuch of the work we do, as computer scientists, relies on distributions. Many algorithms need to be evaluated statistically (since we want to know how they will perform on the "average" case). Networks are modeled statistically, and server performance and load are, too. Machine learning, data mining, computer vision -- these are all statistically based, too. To be a modern computer scientist, I think you have to be comfortable with statistics as a tool.</p>
