<p>\n\nThis is something that you, as a student community, could police. I've been deleting posts and threads that are redundant, but once a post gets an answer or two, it's difficult to justify deleting the thread -- and I don't have the ability to merge them. Instead, I've been pointing to the larger threads, in the hopes that people will read the existing threads and add to them, instead of posting the same questions repetitively.</p>
