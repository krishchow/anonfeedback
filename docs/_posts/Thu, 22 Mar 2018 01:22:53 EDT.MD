[quote]Hypothetical: someone gets a permanent tattoo of the calc formulas and 209 notes before the exam on their arms. They wear a half sleeve tee shirt on the exams for calc and 209. Those tattoos are an unauthorized aid but they cannot be removed. Is it an academic offense? \n\nP.S. this may or may not be hypothetical (i.e this is not a joke as I heard people considering it).[/quote]\n\nThis was debated as an issue at MIT for a while. Well, not this, but it's related. A group was experimenting with wearable computers (essentially goggles with a CPU attached) a few years ago, and a couple students made the claim that since they wore the devices constantly, in all environments, and since they had become accustomed to experiencing reality with augmentation, that the wearable had become an extension of self.  (i.e., They claimed that they were cyborgs.) \n\nAt U of T, they'd tell you to cover up, since you'd have an aid that someone else had. Similarly, if you wore a linux reference guide T-shirt to the exam, they'd probably tell you to wear a jacket. Or a zealous invigilator would charge you with intending to commit an offense.
