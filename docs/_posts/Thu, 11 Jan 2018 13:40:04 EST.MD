[quote='kaursach' pid='24163' dateline='1515688667']\nI would recommend having extra office hours on Wednesday if it is possible. Due to most student's tutorials/lectures conflict with your Tuesday OH.[/quote]\n\nThanks for the response. Unfortunately, my time this term is pretty restricted. I'm not regularly going to be on campus on Wednesdays, so while you're welcome to drop by if my door is open, I can't schedule regular office hours that day.
