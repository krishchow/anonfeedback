[quote]Some PCRS videos are not focused on a specific topic. She often mentions different minor points in one video, and it's hard for the viewer to keep track of them all. I believe having a course textbook, as clear as the one for 258, would be very helpful.[/quote]\n\nThat's interesting feedback. I get way more complaints about the 258 book than I do props. \n\nThere are two recommended texts for this course, and you might take a look at them to see if they give you the info you need in a format you prefer. For C, I recommend King's [url=http://go.utlib.ca/cat/6676720]C Programming[/url]. For Linux and OS issues, I recommend Kerrisk's [url=http://go.utlib.ca/cat/10030432]The Linux Programming Interface[/url].\n\nI'll look into adding a few optional readings for these texts in the next day or so. (But that will, of course, push off marking a bit longer. Every bit of work takes time, and marking tends to get pushed to the bottom of my priority list.)\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] I've placed some reference readings onto the L0101 lecture page.
