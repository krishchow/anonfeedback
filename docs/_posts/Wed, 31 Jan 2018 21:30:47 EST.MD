[quote]I've never submitted a feedback ever in any class, but the labs are really starting to frustrate me. For 2 weeks in a row, I've completed my quartus about 30 min before class ending and then there's always this "same name" error that turns up when I run my circuit. The worse part is when I call the TA over, they are absolutely 0 help and kind of just leave me there to die. You put in all the work the whole time and before lab drawing diagrams and you don't even get the full marks just because there's an error that supposedly NO ONE has solutions to and you are left there to figure it out on your own. I'd assume that the TA's are there to help and I'm not the only person with this problem. A lot of people face the same situation in labs and we are all very frustrated with the quartus and the TAs. It would be nice if a solution to this error was posted or if the TAs were taught how to fix the problem. Thankyou. [/quote]\n\nI'm sorry you haven't been able to get help in the labs. [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=7841]I've posted a thread. I need more information to diagnose the issue.[/url] This is, by the way, one drawback of anonymous feedback: it doesn't allow for a discussion, and debugging often requires a back-and-forth conversation.
