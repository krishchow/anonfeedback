[quote=Anonymous]What do UTM CS students do in fourth year? Given UTM's interactive timetable, it looks like there's only 12 300/400 CS courses. Are we supposed to take all our fourth year courses at UTSG? If so, are there still priority controls on these courses?[/quote]

<p>\n\nYou should probably come talk to me about this, rather than sending it anonymously. If you'd prefer, you could talk to Arnold Rosenbloom, the faculty advisor, instead.  \n\nIn short: We offer enough courses that any student can graduate using only UTM courses (going to StG is not necessary), but many students take at least one course downtown, because there are more choices on that campus.  Some students take a majority of their fourth year downtown, either because they find it easier to manage their schedule in one location or because they want to focus on courses that UTM doesn't offer. I'd ask your upper year colleagues, just to get a sense of what they do and what courses they tend to take downtown.</p>
