[quote]Is there any way we could get an extension on the assignment 2 for CSC209? I'm having trouble with it at the moment and the coming week is filled with multiple assignment due dates and tests. I know this is not a valid excuse but I feel that even an additional day or two would help greatly. [/quote]\n\nIt's not an extension, but [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=8010&action=lastpost]you may use the resubmission date without incurring a penalty[/url]. If you take this option, please check your code carefully. There won't be a resubmit available if your code fails to compile.  \n\nWe opted against an extension because of availability during reading week. There are students who have made plans to not be at the university or working, so an extension into reading week would be unfair to them.
