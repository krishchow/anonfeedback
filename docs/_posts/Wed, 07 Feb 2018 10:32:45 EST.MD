<p>\n\nYou're lucky. I think we just did!\n\nBut for the future: please remember that I often delay looking at anonymous feedback until other channels, like email, are caught up. It's not a good channel for asking questions or making time-sensitive requests. Just drop me an email or stop by at the beginning of class.</p>
