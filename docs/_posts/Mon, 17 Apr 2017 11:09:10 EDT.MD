[quote]I basically failed A4, because my program has bugs in the copying process. I know itâ€™s a long shot in asking you this, but I will do it anyways.

<p>\n\nIs it possible for me to ask you for A4 remark if I made drastic changes in my code in order to make it work, even if it means that I will take a greater penalty?[/quote]\n\nIt can't hurt to submit a remark (by the end of the day today, at the absolute latest), but I'm not, generally, accepting resubmissions that are simply fixing errors in the code. I'm looking for minimal changes that allow us to test code that was in your original submission.</p>
