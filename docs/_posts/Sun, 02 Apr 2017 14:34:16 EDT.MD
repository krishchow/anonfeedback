[quote]I sent you a remark request yesterday. Why haven't you answered?[/quote]\n\nSorry for the delay -- but there's other work to do first. I'm prioritizing reviewing the A3 testing and getting the first round of A4 testing done. It could be a few days for remarks: I also need to get marks back in my other course, and there are non-teaching tasks to do. \n\nAlso, it's a weekend. Your expectations are unreasonable.  \n\nIn my original post, I told you that I'd start handling remarks on Wednesday, and that's my best (current) estimate of when you'll get a response from me.
