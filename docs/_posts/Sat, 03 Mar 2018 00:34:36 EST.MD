[quote]What is the male to female ratio in cs post?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nBetween 4:1 and 5:1, if you include the minor but don't include first year. I'd need to request exact stats to know where it is this year (and don't know if they'd actually give them to me), but that's been the (rough) historical average.\n\nI received another interesting question about the gender balance, and I'm holding that question for a day or two. I need to gather/reread a couple of resources to build a proper response, and I've asked Prof. Zingaro if he'd like to comment.</p>
