I received three comments that it’s taking a while for the TAs to get to you -- and that another TA is needed.   [i]Thanks for letting me know.[/i]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nBelieve it or not, this course already has more TA hours per section than most (which is why we have two TAs in the room instead of just one). Hence, I don't think we'll be successful getting a new TA for the course. Instead, I’ve asked the TA scheduled to work the second half of the term if he can start early -- and I'll shift some of responsibilities off of grading and onto lab contact.\n\nThat’s not a full-term fix, since we'll be back down to two TAs in the lab starting in week 8, when we start assembly programming. However, the assembly labs probably don’t need (historically haven't needed) as much support as the ones that use Quartus, so I think two TAs will be sufficient. If it's not, please do let me know.</p>
