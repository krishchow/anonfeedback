[quote=Anonymous]ETA on midterm marking with all the info you have?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThis won't be a satisfying answer, but I really can't say at this point. \n\nBased on the first few, I'm expecting each midterm to take about 10 minutes to mark. 120 submissions at 10 minutes is 20 hours.  Add 2 hours for entering marks and doing some analysis on the results. I don't see pulling that kind of time together this week, but beyond that, I'm not certain.</p>
