[quote]the videos cause much difficulty in its use, sometimes I just want to skip backwards and the whole video fails to functions as expected, yes i can download it, but what's the point of putting a video player in the site if its failure is to be expected? any possible ameliorations are welcomed [/quote]

<p>\n\nWe (the student doing PCRS development this term and I) could use your help with this. We know that students are experiencing issues with the video player, but [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=4074]we can't replicate them[/url]. If you would be willing to describe what occurred and to provide information on what OS, browser, and most importantly, plugins you're using, that would help us a great deal.\n\nLonger term: PCRS just embeds the video player of the streaming video service being used, and I think we need to move away from the mymedia service used by the 108 videos. Most other courses that use PCRS are using youtube, and I don't have nearly as many (or any, really) bug reports regarding video players from those courses. That won't help you this term, though. Sorry!</p>
