[quote]Everyone will get destroyed on this exam. I'm having a feeling you made this year's exam really hard. [/quote]\n\nContrary to popular belief, profs don't set out to create hard (or easy) exams. Sometimes we make mistakes, but we intend to evaluate what the class covered. \n\nIf you don't believe me, think about it this way: even if a prof were tempted to do so, making an intentionally difficult exam isn't worth the hassle. It's depressing to grade (for you and the TAs), you have to explain the result to other faculty in the department (the Chair, primarily), and there would be endless student complaints and remark requests afterward.
