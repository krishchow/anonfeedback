[quote]When will we get our marks for w2/w3 lab and our a1 marks?[/quote]\n\nI promise them by May 1. Probably far earlier.  \n\nThat's snarky, but I don't have an estimate I'm confident of. I was hoping to get w2/w3 returned last week, but some unexpected work came up. For better or worse, returning marks is always at the bottom of my priority list: if something more urgent comes up, it gets pushed back.
