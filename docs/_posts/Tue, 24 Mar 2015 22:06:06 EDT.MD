<p>\n\nIt's an artifact of my writing/thinking process. I write. Read what I've written. Rewrite. Read what I've written. Toss it away. Rewrite.

I could also do more of my editing in a text editor and then copy and paste the final result into a thread, but I tend to just write and edit (and think and edit and edit and edit) directly on the discussion board.</p>
