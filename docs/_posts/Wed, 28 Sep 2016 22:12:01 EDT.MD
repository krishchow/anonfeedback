[quote]<snip> ... I have to go for participation marks... I already go to other profs&#x27; lectures but is there anyway around this problem?[/quote]

<p>\n\nAt the moment, not while using an iClicker. We don't receive enough information from the iClicker reports to identify students who are not in our section. (Later in the term, we may be able to get around this.) However, we do offer a non-Clicker method for earning participation marks: submitting responses to each question in the lecture on paper. \n\nIf you're going to take this option, please send me an email to let me know to expect your responses. Submit them once per week, providing ~1 sentence per question that states the correct option and explains (briefly) why it is correct. There is an envelope on my door (DH3096) where you can submit your responses if I am not in the office.</p>
