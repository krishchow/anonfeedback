[quote]Was there a significance in the midterm for CSC209 and CSC263 being held on the same day(Mar 3rd)? The courses are offered by the same department and are taken by the same subset of students. You guys are so evil. [/quote]\n\nNo, no significance. We just don't coordinate with each other on test dates, except to make sure that two courses using the same tutorial room aren't on the same day. We rely on the students to tell us if there's an issue, and then we adjust.\n\nBut since you're on to us being evil, we can just keep it that way ... ? :dodgy:
