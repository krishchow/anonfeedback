[quote]Who creates the script for marking labs?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nA TA. Two of them have 20 hours in their contract for creating scripts.  \n\nAt the beginning of the week, I send them a list of things I want a mark for, and they send a script by Friday. I run the script, then review the marks. I sometimes change the marking after looking at the results. This lab was particularly tricky to mark, since (1) people changed print statements in their code left and right and (2) text responses are always tricky. It ended up taking a couple hours to get the script marking most people correctly.</p>
