[quote]In downtown's CSC258 I've heard they are using verilog in lab, what's the difference? Do you think if we should learn verilog after class if we have time?[/quote]\n\n258 downtown is much more digital design focused and has less architecture. That's partly just flavor; the primary instructor downtown is Steve Engels, who is an engineer, and I'm an architect. We see different value in the material, so we stress different pieces.  So, where they spend time in lab creating a capstone design (a large project built in hardware), we spend that time building a mini-processor and then spend more time on the hardware-software interface (syscalls and exceptions).  \n\nAs a result, they need to use a language, rather than schematics, to build their hardware because they're writing more complex structures. (We'll do one lab where we build hardware using a high level design language like Verilog/VHDL, just so you get a taste of it.) We use schematics, instead of a HDL, because they align more closely to the work that we're doing in exercises.
