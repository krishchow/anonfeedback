[quote]I was told by my BIO152 TA that my iClicker was not registered for that course.  There is a chance that my iClicker is not registered for the CSC108 course either.  Is there a way I can still get participation marks? I have gone to every lecture so far.[/quote]

<p>\n\nIf you've been doing the clicker exercises, your activity has been registered -- we just don't know who to give the marks to. Once you register your clicker with your utorid for this course, it'll retroactively associate your utorid with the answers you've submitted, so you'll get credit for participation.</p>
