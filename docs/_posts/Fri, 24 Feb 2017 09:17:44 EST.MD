[quote]When will we get our A2 marks back?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\n[i]Marks[/i] will be a while. At least a week from today. I had hoped to get the assignments to TAs earlier this week, but it's only going to happen today.\n\nHowever, [i]test results[/i] (not marks) will be emailed out early next week, once the assignment is submitted at StG.</p>
