<p>\n\nWell, first: could you please stop sending questions about the post via anonymous feedback to Dan? They're questions, not feedback. Also, Dan is just forwarding them. You could start a thread in the "General" tab on the discussion board, if you like.  \n\nYou're also welcome to set up a time to see me (or to drop by during office hours).  \n\nYou do need to be in a POSt once you have earned 4.0 credits. If you won't have the requirements for a CS major or specialist POSt, you can apply for a CS minor POSt and then enroll in a type 1 program of some sort (a program with few or no requirements) as a placeholder. However, if you were not admitted to CS, you should spend some time reflecting on or investigating why you were not admitted. You may decide that you should pursue a different path to graduate: a statistics major, for example, with a CSC minor and a BIO minor.</p>
