<p>\n[quote]Yeah i dont get FSM exercises at all .. cant even follow with the example[/quote]\n\nYou're going to have to go non-anonymous to get help. I don't know where you're having trouble (:huh:), but I'm guessing it would be best to talk through an example in front of a whiteboard. Office hours are 2-3 Monday and Friday. I may also be available Wednesday (if the door is open or if you send me email to set up a time).  \n\nAnonymous also says:\n[quote]Are FSM's like DFA's from 236? Why is the book making it complicated? I don't think we did an example of this in class.[/quote]\n\nYes, a finite state machine is a discrete finite automata. We did two examples in class: the modulo counter and goldeneye pen.</p>
