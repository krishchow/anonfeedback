<p>\n\n[quote]What the fuck was that ???[/quote]\n\n[quote]Fair midterm. from my sample size of 3 friends, we think that overall, the midterm had more "syntax" memorization then we expected. \n\nWith that being said, I think the syntax, we were required to recall to complete the questions were important ones that any systems programmer should have nailed in their head. \n\nBut there's also the thought that losing marks for question because you forgot to put "then" in the bash conditional statement feels bad and that its a trivial matter.[/quote]\n\nWe're not being too picky about syntax. On one hand, we [i]are[/i] requiring square brackets around conditionals in bash (... 'cause otherwise it looks like C), but are being a bit lax about "then."  \n\nWe'll see how it goes. The TAs did a little bit of marking today (Q1 and part of Q2), but the bulk of the marking happens tomorrow.</p>
