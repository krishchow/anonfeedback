[quote]I got called for interview but didn't do any academic offence. What questions are asked in these interviews because I forgot most of the assignment that was 3 weeks back and don't have much time to go through it in the middle of other exams.[/quote]

<p>\n\nIf the interview is with me (for 209), then don't bother to review your code. I won't be asking about it. I will show you the evidence that sparked the investigation and ask you to provide an explanation as to why the two submissions could be similar. They could, for example, both be based on code from lecture or from an online source that you referenced appropriately.</p>
