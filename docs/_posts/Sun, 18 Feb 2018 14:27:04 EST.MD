[quote]I was under the impression that labs were allowed to be collaborative? Is this not true? [/quote]

<p>\n\nI expect that being in the lab, with classmates around, means that you'll speak to them, and having the TA in the room means that there will often be a single approach that the entire section takes on a given problem. However, you should still be writing and debugging your own code. I shouldn't be seeing, for example, identical comments in multiple submissions.</p>
