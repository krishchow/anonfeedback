[quote]For every quiz we do, can we only receive whole number marks like 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3.

<p>\n\nor can we also receive decimal marks like:\n\n0.25\n0.5\n2.5\n1.5\n2.4\n2.9\n[/quote]\n\nIt depends on the quiz. The one this week has whole number marks. \n\nI think it highly unlikely that I'll split it up below halves, though. If I want a 2.25 / 3, I'll just make it 4.5 / 6 or 9 / 12.</p>
