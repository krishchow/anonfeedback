[quote]I've noticed that some of the multiple choice answers are wrong because when the exact same question is tested, the choice combination does not make sense. Please double check that the answers (especially when the question has multiple answers) are correct. Also, the full screen mode for the videos do not work with google chrome. [/quote]\n\nBluntly: I doubt it. :-) (We're not perfect, but these questions have been used for a couple years.) If you find a question that has answers you believe are incorrect, please post them in the PCRS forum. If you're right, I'll buy you a coffee (or you choice of Tim Horton's or Starbucks beverage). If you're wrong, then we can help you see why.\n\nThe full screen mode isn't a browser issue: it works fine on my version of chrome, for example. I think it's related to your multimedia plug-in, but we haven't yet isolated the issue. We have a work-study student looking into it, but for now, I recommend trying a different browser or, if necessary, downloading the video and playing it on your system's player.
