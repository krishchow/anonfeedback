[quote]Was the reasoning for having the 10% resubmit penalty instead of the 20% a result of the issues that were raised last year? Having the penalty only be 10% and having a few days to fix an assignment has been very useful so far, and having these in the future I think most would agree would help keep the number of people dropping the course to a minimal.[/quote]

<p>\n\nThe feedback last year was that 20% felt punitive, so I reduced it this year. I'm trying to find the sweet spot where the penalty encourages people to turn it in on time (and hence, have a few extra days to fix things up if necessary) and do testing their own [i]without[/i] making it feel like a resubmit is a failure. \n\nThe jury is still out on whether 10% is the right number. We'll see after A3 and A4.</p>
