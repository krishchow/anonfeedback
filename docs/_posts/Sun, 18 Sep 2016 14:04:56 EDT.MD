[quote]Do I have to be in the lecture session I'm enrolled in to get marks for using the clickers, or can I go to any lecture?[/quote]

<p>\n\nThe iClicker setup has some limitations. In particular, I only have the classlist for my class, so I can't give you credit for your iClicker responses if you are attending from another section.  We'll see if we can get around this, but for now, you will need to attend the lecture section that you're enrolled in to get credit if you use an iClicker.</p>
