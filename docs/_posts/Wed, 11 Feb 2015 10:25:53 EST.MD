[quote=Anonymous]this is a rant; What is the point of bonus marks if you there's no bonus to be earned. No point in giving us more than 2/2 then if the max we can get is the same as anyone who got 2/2  on all of them.[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nA student asked this in office hours a week or so ago, and I asked for time to think about it. \n\n1. Even if they don't  add up beyond the full 20%, bonus marks would let you, at some point, skip a lab or two. That's valuable -- especially around midterm time or at the end of the term.\n\n2. However, I don't especially want someone to skip a lab, since the midterm and/or final could have a question that is based on lab material.  \n\nSo I ended up deciding to just add up all of the marks for labs -- without capping them. ([url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=2881&pid=8434#pid8434]There's a recent post on the board about this in the lab section.[/url])\n\nAside: That's a polite rant. Thanks. :-)</p>
