[quote]Hey Andrew, I was talking to TA Kimchi and he gave me a life changing quote: \n\n"it's not about the destination, but it's about the journey"\n\nSo, if my program Segfaults that shouldn't matter too much. It's how I got to the segmentation fault. I feel as if this is how we should be marked.\n\n~ Code Bonobo[/quote]\n\nAh, you're right. You got to the seg fault by (a) not checking errors or (b) mismanaging connections between data and pointers, both of which are important mental errors that I should discourage. I should be removing even more marks ...\n\nOn the next assignment, assignments that segmentation fault will be worth -9000 marks, rather than 0! :cool:
