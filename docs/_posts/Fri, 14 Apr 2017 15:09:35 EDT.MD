[quote]For A4:
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIf you let students make their own makefile (without providing any detailed specifications on it), then why do you compile with your own solution makefile, rather than than the students'?\n\nYou could compile the assignment with the students' makefile, and have TA's mark the makefiles manually (for separate compilation and other requirements).\n\nAdditionally, if students have to change their makefile - despite the assignment compiling and working correctly under it - just because it differs from the solution one, then do they take a -20% FLAT mark reduction? [/quote]\n\nWe end up using a set of our own server functions when we mark, so we can display messages received from the client, so we need a Makefile with more sources and targets than the Makefile we asked you to write.</p>
