[quote]Why did you choose to make 209 in a language as old as C rather than something like Java?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThere almost is a choice. We're looking at the interface between the user and the operating system (systems programming), and C remains the primary language in that domain. C was originally created to replace assembly languages for systems programming, and many operating systems and systems tools are still written in that language. Gnu/Linux is primarily written in C, for example, and the libraries that other languages use, like Python, are often written in C and have a wrapper around them.  (Heck, one of the popular Python implementations is written in C ...)\n\nThat being said, we [i]could[/i] use a higher level language. However, very few languages provide a raw interface to memory like C does, and I think there's value in learning about that interface. It forces you to confront the idea that you're executing code on a machine and that the code you write is manipulating resources on that machine.</p>
