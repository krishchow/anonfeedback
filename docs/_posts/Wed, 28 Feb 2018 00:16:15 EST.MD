[quote]For the love of god and everything please donâ€™t make POSt 3.00. Thanks [/quote]\n\nHere's the normal caveat: it's not up to me. This is a full faculty decision, and we generally operate by consensus.\n\nWith that out of the way: I don't, personally, see a reason to push it that high this year. However, when we discuss these issues, a number of factors play into the decision: stress on the student body, stress on the faculty, the number of instructors available to teach third and fourth year courses, the perceived quality of the education we're able to offer (are we able to provide for the community? work with students individually or in small groups?), and the perceived quality of students leaving the program (are the students in third and fourth year meeting the outcomes we've set as graduation expectations?). We make the decision based on what we think is good for the community -- not what is good for any particular individual student.\n\nWith those issues in mind, from my perspective, we've taken on too much in the past few years in an attempt to reduce the impact on the student body, and the growth has lead to a number of negative consequences. As we grow the faculty complement, develop administrative supports, and encourage the development of a student community, we should be able to counter some of those effects and should be able to gradually increase the size of the CS program. That will eventually reduce the requirements, but it's not going to take a while.
