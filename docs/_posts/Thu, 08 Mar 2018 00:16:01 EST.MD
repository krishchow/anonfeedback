[quote]Do companies ask what campus of uoft you went to during interviews?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nYou might ask the MCSS execs, as they've done some interviews and will know graduating students who are looking for (or have found) jobs for after graduation. They'd probably have a more precise answer than I.  \n\nFrom what I've heard, the answer is "no." They're more interested in the skills you can demonstrate with your portfolio and interview. However, if they wanted to know what campus you went to, they could figure it out from your transcript.</p>
