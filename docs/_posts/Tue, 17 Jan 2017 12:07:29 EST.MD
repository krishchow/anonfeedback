[quote]For PCRS, I think the questions are too ambiguous at times. Specifically for coding questions in labs, I feel the questions are sometimes too vague leading to confusion and many of us wasting time just trying to understand what the question wants. I'm not sure if anyone has brought this up before but, I just wanted to let you know.[/quote]

<p>\n\nYes, wording is always tricky. If there's a question you're having trouble understanding, please don't hesitate to post a question about it on the board. Don't spend time beating your head against it. If you're stuck, post it and move on. You can try it with a clear head (and more information) later in the week.\n\nI'd also welcome suggestions for how to improve the wording of the questions. We share these resources with the downtown instructors, so if you send me a problem that you think is difficult to understand (as well as a suggested wording), I'll put it into a list for review with the other instructors. Thanks in advance!</p>
