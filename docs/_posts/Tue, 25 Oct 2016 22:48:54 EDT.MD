[quote]I just wanted to make an anonymous suggestion in regards to the PCRS. The PCRS system is great but not amazing. I suggest that in addition to the multiple choice, more practice code questions should be put in. In fact, some questions that only have multiple choice should be replaced by code practice questions instead. I have no idea how this can be possible but it could definitely help out students willing to learn.[/quote]

<p>\n\nThank you for the feedback!\n\nI agree. We could use some more coding questions, in particular early in the course. The CSC108 material was created a few years ago, before we added facilities for testing very small snippets of code, and it would be worthwhile to allocate some TA time to creating some very early coding questions. We'll look into it this summer.</p>
