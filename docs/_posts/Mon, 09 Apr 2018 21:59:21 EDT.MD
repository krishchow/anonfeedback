[quote]How much different is cs specialist and major? Are the extra courses required a lot harder?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nA specialist is basically a double major. You have to take almost twice as many computer science courses. \n\nWe also require [i]breadth[/i] from a specialist. A student in the major can pick and choose courses, which means they can avoid an entire section of the discipline (everything theory related, for example, or anything in systems). However, we require that specialists take courses from across the discipline, so that they're exposed to a wide variety of ideas. I don't know that the required courses are [i]harder[/i] -- some electives, such as CSC463, are among the most difficult of the courses we offer -- but you can't avoid taking courses in areas in which you are weaker if you are in the specialist.</p>
