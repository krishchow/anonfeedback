[quote]I was reading that there were too many A's and B';s in the course, is there a certain average that the course average should be at?[/quote]

<p>\n\nJust be absolutely clear: [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=4649&pid=18293#pid18293]this post is a joke[/url].\n\nBeyond that, there isn't a set average or distribution that a course should have. There's some expectation that the distribution of a course should be relatively similar from year to year. If there's a deviation, we should know why. Also, there's an expectation that over multiple years, we don't have a course where a very large number of students fail or get A's. In the latter case, we'd be expected to alter how the course fits into the program, either by providing more support in the prereqs or altering the course outcomes.</p>
