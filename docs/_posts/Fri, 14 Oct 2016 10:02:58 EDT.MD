[quote]Can you please upload the answers to the ConcepTest as well, with the notes? It becomes a little simple to study if a student misses a lecture. [/quote]

<p>\n\nSorry, but no. Two reasons:\n\n1) The lecture notes are "shared property". They've been built over several terms by various instructors, but the original instructor to use concepttests at UTM, Dan Zingaro, doesn't want answers posted.\n\n2) Beyond that, I agree with his reasons for not posting answers: reading an answer is different, in terms of support for learning, from choosing (committing to) an answer. The former doesn't require that you actively formulate an answer, and the latter does. If we post the answers, it suggests that just knowing the answer to that particular question is important, and that's not it. We want you to be able to figure out the answer for a whole set of related questions.\n\nAll that being said: you should be able to check your answer on almost every question, because the question is about code. Type in the code in Python. Then type in your chosen option: does it work as you expect?</p>
