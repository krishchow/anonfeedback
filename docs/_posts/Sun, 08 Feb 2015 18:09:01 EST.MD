Anonymous says:\n[quote]Quizzes are too hard[/quote]\n\nThe quiz questions so far have been drawn directly from the recommended exercises and the questions/points of emphasis outlined in the reading guides. At a minimum, I recommend doing the recommended exercises and preparing answers to the questions in the reading guide.\n\n(Also, note that the solutions to the odd numbered exercises are available online. See the course webpage for a link.)\n\nI also invite you to bring your past quizzes to office hours. We can review them and discuss how to prepare for upcoming weeks.
