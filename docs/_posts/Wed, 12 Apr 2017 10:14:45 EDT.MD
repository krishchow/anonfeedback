[quote]Do you usually boost students to a pass if they are around 47%-49% or will you just give them the failing mark? [/quote]\n\nI usually look at individual assignments and exams (were questions unfair or too difficult?) and alter the marking schemes for those individual elements. Once those individual elements are adjusted, then the marks fall where they fall. \n\nI [i]do[/i] look at marks right at CGPA boundaries. For example, if someone has a 69.4, then I might call that a 70, since it makes a big difference to CGPA and I'm not confident that I can differentiate between a student with a 69.4 and a student with a 69.5. However, a mark at 58.9 ... that's a 59.
