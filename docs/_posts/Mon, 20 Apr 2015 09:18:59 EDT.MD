[quote=Anonymous]Are you really going to fail us if we get below 40 on the final? I know dan and Abbas and all the other CS profs say they only have the 40 rule so people don't just get others to do assignments for them and pass the course. However, in this class I feel like since our test component is already so large due to quizzes and the midterm, it's not so needed.[/quote]
