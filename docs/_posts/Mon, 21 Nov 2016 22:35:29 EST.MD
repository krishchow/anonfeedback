[quote]How important do you think it is to take second year proofs? Would you recommend it to a CS Major/Specialist?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nFair warning: I'm biased. I've tried, at various times, to get second year proofs into the CS program. It wasn't been included because the general feeling in the faculty was that it wasn't directly relevant to CS. On my side, I think it's valuable preparation for the upper year theory courses and, more generally, I'd recommend it because it provides practice structuring evidence, identifying edge cases, and thinking creatively.</p>
