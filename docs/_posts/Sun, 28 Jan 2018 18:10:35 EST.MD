<p>\nvoid update_contact (struct &amp;c, char *n, int nu, char *a){\n^&quot;\n\nWhat does this error even mean? This isn&#x27;t really useful.[/quote]\n\nI pasted the raw output I get from anonymous feedback above. Note all of the escape characters; that's because we have to be careful of code injections.\n\nSo, two things:\n\n1) Sending code over anonymous feedback mashes it up. It's not a good channel for code.\n\n2) This is a question that might help other students -- not feedback to me. There's no reason for it to be asked anonymously: it's an interesting question, and you're not criticizing me or asking something that might be embarrassing. So please just post it on the board, where more people will see it and can join the discussion.</p>
