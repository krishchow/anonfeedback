[quote]Reading the anonymous feedback lately, I am curious as to how many people late withdrawed from the course. When you talked about typical fail rates earlier and said 10%-20%, was late withdrawal also included in the fail count? [/quote]

<p>\n\nI'm not sure. I can probably get that data in a day or two, if you're really interested. The 10-20% figure was from looking at marks -- the number of "F" grades divided by the total enrollment at the exam -- so it didn't include withdrawals or late withdrawals.</p>
