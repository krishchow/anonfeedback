[quote]When can we expect our midterm remarks to be out?[/quote]\n\nNo later than October 1? Seriously -- I've answered the question about remarks multiple times. Asking the question again won't get you a better answer.\n\nI put remarks last in my priority order, since each remark (1) can take significant time, (2) only affects one student, and (3) doesn't provide significant new information that will help you do better on the next piece of marked work. Until the first round of marking for all of the labs, A3 marks, and A4 testing is completed, remarks are on the back burner.
