[quote]Do you know when will the final exam mark and the course grade be available? Btw thanks for an awesome semester![/quote]

<p>\n\nMarks are due 5 business days after the exam -- so they're due on Friday, in our case. I'm hoping to make that deadline. However, the marks themselves may not post for a few days after, as they need to be reviewed by the Chair and by the Office of the Registrar.</p>
