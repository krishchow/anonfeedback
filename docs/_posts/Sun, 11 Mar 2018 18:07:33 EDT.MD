[quote]There are two codes for a CS specialist POSt:
<!-- more -->
<p>\nERSPE1688 Specialist - Computer Science\nand\nERSPE1688X Specialist - Computer Science, in this code what does the "X" mean ?\n[/quote]\n\nThe X code refers to a deprecated program: an old formulation of the program. No one can be admitted to a program with an X on it, but they have to keep it in the system in case a student who was in that program requests graduation.</p>
