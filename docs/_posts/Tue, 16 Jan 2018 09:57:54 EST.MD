[quote]I very much like the thorough PCRS videos and exercises. When we did it in 108 it was pretty bad but there are a few personal reasons related to that. Also, just wanted to say how much of an amazing Professor you are. Hopefully in the future I'll be able to work with you on something either related to research or development :D[/quote]

<p>\n\nI'm glad they're working for you! PCRS doesn't work for everyone, but I really do think the exercises provide a good check of whether you're following along with the material. That being said: the wording can often be improved, and we could use a wider variety of exercises.\n\nAlso, thanks for the cheery note. It brightened up my morning.</p>
