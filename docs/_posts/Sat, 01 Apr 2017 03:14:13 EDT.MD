[quote]In last year's CS Post you said that 2nd year programming course (csc207 and csc209) would be counted if you didn't meet the minimum cutoff right? So, now here is a scenario imagine if a studentA didn't meet the cutoff for either 3 of the courses (148, 207, 209).In contrast, studentB who has the required average in 148 but didn't take 207 and 209 and took other 2nd courses like 236, and 258 for the sake of completing the minor, and did well in them. Given that StudentB has the required averages for all the 1st year courses and the set CGPA then they should get into the cs post, whereas StudentA should not. Is this correct?[/quote]

<p>\n\nIf this is more than a hypothetical, then you should come in and talk to me, so we can review your situation. Without looking at all the details, it looks like Student B has a shot at getting accepted to the major, while Student A does not.</p>
