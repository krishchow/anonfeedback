[quote]Sorry for asking in feedback, but were we supposed to use htons instead of htonl for the mode and size? Or did you guys not use ntoh(l/s) when printing the struct data in the results text file?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nWe didn't do any byteswapping when we printed the data (and we only compared the paths in the structs when we calculated correctness for those entries). You should have swapped bytes to network order, but in order to do so for the mode and size, you'd have to do so manually (or use bswap_64), since htons and htonl only work on 2 byte and 4 byte values, respectively.</p>
