[quote]CSC209 is probably the best course I have taken so far in the past 13 years of education. I really like the way the course was instructed, especially the inverted format with PCRS. In the future I think it would be great if sockets was added to PCRS since that is what took me the longest to learn. I am looking forward to courses such as 358, 369, 385, 469, and 458. As an aside, I think one reason the inverted learning approach works well for me is because it allows me to pause and test out the stuff in the video, which is difficult to do in the classroom due to time constraints, and being limited to a single monitor.

<p>\n\nI'm glad the course worked for you!\n\nWe'll be doing some course development over the summer, and creating videos for sockets is on the list.</p>
