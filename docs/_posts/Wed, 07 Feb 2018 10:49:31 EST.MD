[quote]Why are we covering so much more material than previous offerings?[/quote]\n\nWe're not.  \n\nI last taught this course in 2014. Prof. Zhang taught it 2015-17. I'm using my outline of topics from 2014 as a skeleton for the course. I'm updating the reading guides as we're going along, so I know we're not covering more than 2014. The topics are the same. I gave my notes and lab materials to Prof. Zhang to use as a basis for the 2014 offering, and looking at his 2017 course notes, it looks quite similar. He cut latency, it looks like, but he added more detail on digital design.
