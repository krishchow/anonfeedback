[quote='kaursach' pid='24105' dateline='1515597883']\nWill the course ever be offered again?[/quote]\n\nIt's offered most terms. To do a 492, a student needs to propose a topic area (or specific project, in some cases) to an instructor. The instructor has to agree, and then the two agree on a marking scheme for the course. Then, in theory, the Chair or a designate approves the project idea and marking scheme, but in practice, any project a faculty member is willing to endorse is approved.  \n\nThe trick is to find an instructor who can supervise a project you want to do. Supervising a project takes time, so it has to be something they are interested in and/or it has to be important enough to you that they're willing to take on the additional work. \n\nProf. Rosenbloom typically works with a student or two each term. Prof. Zingaro does, as well. Recently, I've done more 399's (year long courses) than 492's, but that's probably just a function of the projects that I've been involved in.
