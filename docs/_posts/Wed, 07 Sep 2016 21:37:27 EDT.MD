[quote]"Prepare" from PCRS should be due at 11:59pm rather than 10pm. It compensates for LEC105 ending at 6:00pm and gives all students a reasonable amount of additional  time.[/quote]

<p>\n\nDo you mean "Perform"? "Prepare" is due on Sunday, so I don't think the extra couple hours will help much. If so, I'm okay with pushing the deadline back a couple hours. Regardless, please don't push the exercises to the last minute: you should be able to complete most of them by Wednesday, and you may not be able to get last minute help at 10 or 11 p.m.</p>
