[quote]Will taking csc258 help me understand some parts of csc209 better or improve my mark in 209?[/quote]

<p>\n\nYou'll definitely see connections -- and might get material reinforced -- between the two courses, and that could improve your mark. We introduce the memory model at the beginning of CSC209, and you'll see it again at the end of CSC258, when we work with assembly. We'll also spend some time looking at the compiler toolchain in CSC258, and that might help explain why C compiles code the way that it does.  \n\nLater, in the CSC369 (operating systems), you'll see the content from the two courses starting to blend. You'll have to write C code to manage hardware structures, and you might spend some time looking at why some C code runs more quickly/efficiently than others (because of the underlying hardware and OS behaviour).</p>
