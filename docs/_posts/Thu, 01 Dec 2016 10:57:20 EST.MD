[quote]Can you explain what happens when we fail a course that isn't necessary to major in cs(like not cs108 or mat135 but i.e. psychology)?[/quote]\n\nYour CGPA drops. That's a fairly significant penalty, since scholarships and the like often depend on CGPA. Admission into a program of study is also often based on CGPA. However, it's not the end of the world if you have one or two bad grades.\n\nHowever, if you fail a number of courses -- or have very low marks in most of your courses -- you could drop below a key threshold. [url=https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/registrar/academic-support/probation-suspension]If your CGPA drops below 1.5, you will be placed "on probation"[/url]. If you are on probation and your marks do not improve, you are placed "on suspension" and will be unable to study at the university for some period of time (1 year, the first time, then three years, then never again).
