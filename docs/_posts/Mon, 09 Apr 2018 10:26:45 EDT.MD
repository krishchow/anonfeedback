[quote]How lenient will the exam be with writing the code? Similar to the midterm's makefile situation, how well do we need to remember the code and what's exactly needed (parameters, arguments, specific lines, entire code etc.)? or what is expected for coding type questions if we are not expected to rewrite the entire code straight from memory?[/quote]

<p>\n\nI'm expecting you to be able to write code that you have practiced in labs and assignments. We don't expect it to be syntactically perfect, but you need to be able to use system calls to solve relevant problems.</p>
