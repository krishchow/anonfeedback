[quote]I am in your CSC108 LEC 0102 class and as I was working on A3 I noticed when I ran the type checker that on line 39 the type checker tests the function extract_mentions, however the error message says "The list returned by extract_hashtags was empty and should have contained data.\\n". Since the type checker is checking extract_mentions, to avoid further confusion by other students, the error message should read "The list returned by extract_mentions was empty and should have contained data.\\n"[/quote]
