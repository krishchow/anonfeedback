<p>\n\nI'm assuming this is about the POSt changes, given the date it was sent (March 26).\n\n[quote]in your updated post about POST you said “this will not be good news for some of you, and im sorry” if students can choose between using the new or the old requirements then whats wrong ? Isnt it better for everyone ?[/quote]\n\nNo, it removes a path for students in the second or third year who were counting on having their annual GPA evaluated (rather than CGPA) or having second year courses count instead of first year courses. They'll need to apply for a waiver instead, and we have to say that we're not guaranteeing that waivers will be accepted.</p>
