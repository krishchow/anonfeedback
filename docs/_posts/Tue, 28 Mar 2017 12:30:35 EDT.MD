[quote]Hello Andrew, in an earlier post you stated that you believed this years CGPA requirement for the CS Major would be higher than last years. Some questions:\n\n1) Do you still believe this is the case?\n2) I could be VERY incorrect and have misheard but from what I remember Prof Arnold Rosenbloom told me only my 2nd year GPA would be considered when applying again this year. Is that actually the case? Or will it be the students CGPA? \n\nIt's the end of the semester now so I just wanted your input again, thanks. [/quote]\n\n1) Yes, but I won't know until May.\n\n2) CGPA, except in extreme situations. (For example, if you had significant documented medical problems that caused you to repeat year 1, we might omit your first year 1 marks.)
