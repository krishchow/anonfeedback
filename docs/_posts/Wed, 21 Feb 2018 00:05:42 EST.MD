[quote]I don't know if you've heard of this already, but the students writing reviews on ratemyprofs find your smartness "intimidating"... [/quote]\n\nI don't look at that site at all. It's a place to vent, and I'd wager that anonymous feedback generates more constructive and less hyperbolic venting. \n\nIntimidating, though, is not a word I thought I would ever be descriptive of me -- for any reason, let alone "smartness." Maybe I should try smiling more in office hours? :huh:
