[quote]The link for Python 3.4 in the software section is not functioning [/quote]

<p>\n\nI just double-checked it: it looks okay. It's taking you to the info page for Python 3.4.3. To get a download to install Python, look for "Download" on that page, follow the link, and then choose the right download for your system.</p>
