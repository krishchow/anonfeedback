<p>\n\nYes. \n\nThis question comes up every year, at some point. I have to admit that I still find it somewhat unsettling. I think it's that I hadn't realized that race was such a topic of discussion here. \n\nIn any case, feel free to ask other questions in person. I grew up in the southern United States, and I suspect my experiences with race and, in particular, with being mixed-race were very different from a Canadian experience.</p>
