[quote]You deleted my post![/quote]

<p>\n\nProbably, yes. I'm sorry that it took you extra time to get your question answered. \n\nHowever, if I did delete your post, I sent you an email about it, too. I've deleted a handful of posts when they contain a question that is either (a) a duplicate of a question that has already been discussed in another thread or (b) highly related to or extends a discussion in another thread. Having many threads about the same topic makes it difficult to get all of the information about a question. So, before you post, please check to make sure there isn't a pre-existing discussion where your question or comment might fit.</p>
