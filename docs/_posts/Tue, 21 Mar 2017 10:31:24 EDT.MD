[quote]Can you post our A2 marks before we drop the course? Thank you![/quote]

<p>\n\n[quote]Approximately when do you think we'll get our marks for A2 and then also A3? I think it'll help going into A4 to know how well we actually did on A2 and A3. Thank you senpai.[/quote]\n\nMy best guess: A2 marks will be out next week. A3 will be out during the study break. A4 tests will be out before the exam -- but marks may not be returned until after the exam.</p>
