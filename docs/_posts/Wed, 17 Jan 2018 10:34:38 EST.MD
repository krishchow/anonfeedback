[quote]Can I go to prof Sharmin's office hours for 209 or 258 related help?[/quote]\n\nNo. No no no no no no no no. No.\n\nWhy? This is for Prof. Sharmin's benefit and the benefit of the CSC108 students.\n\n1) The CSC108 office hours are for CSC108 students. They tend to be quite busy, and if you're stepping in to ask other questions, their questions won't be answered. \n\n2) Prof. Sharmin is a graduate student, and she's being paid to do a very specific job: teach CSC108 this term. Any other work she is doing is voluntary, on her own time, and that means that your questions are eating into her classwork and research time.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b]\n[quote=Sharmin]While I'm happy to provide general advice on CS major/minor, etc. I don't feel comfortable taking questions about specific courses which I'm not teaching, as I believe it's fair to dedicate my office hours to my own 108 students.[/quote]
