[quote]I am just wondering if the marks on portal are going to be updated for remarks. I had received a remark for A3 and only A3 test results had changes. Does this mean that my mark is the same as before?\n\nSome clarification would be appreciated.[/quote]\n\nThis can't be anonymous. I need to know who you are to check this situation. (Seriously. Why send this anonymously unless you're trolling me to see if I'll double check everyone's mark?)\n\nIn any case, yes, I'm updating portal as I go. If I missed you while updating marks, then your final mark will be incorrect, so you should contact me if this is the case.
