[quote]if we don't get into post, will our GPA need to be higher for second year POST admission?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIf the CGPA requirement for admission goes up, it goes up for all students applying for the POSt. So, if the CGPA requirement is 2.0 (fake number) this year and 3.0 (fake number) next year, you'd need a 3.0 to be admitted as a second year next year.\n\n[quote]What's the GPA requirement for Computer Science specialist this year?[/quote]\nWe won't know until we look at the number of students who graduate from the program this year, the expected number of students in third year next year, and the number of applicants this year. We'll have that info in late April or early May.</p>
