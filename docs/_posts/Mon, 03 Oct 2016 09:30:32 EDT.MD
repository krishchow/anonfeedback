[quote]If I help enough people can I be a TA?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nIt's not so much about helping people as it is about being recognized for being conscientious and understanding the material. Typically, we hire graduate students first, then senior students (third and fourth years). We hire second year students last, and there are very few second year TAs.  \n\nApplications to TA are posted in late June / early July. Keep an eye on these boards or [url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/alumni/jobs/teaching-assistant-postings]on the MCS hiring page[/url] for information on how and when to apply.</p>
