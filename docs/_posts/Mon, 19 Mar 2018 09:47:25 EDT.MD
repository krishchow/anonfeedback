[quote]When do you expect a4 to be posted because of when I'm writing this its due in 2weeks + 1day so I'm starting to get kinda worried because I want to start it asap so I can study for exams, as well Its covering some new topics which are going to be difficult to debug as we don't have much experience with sockets[/quote]\n\nYes, I'm a bit worried, too. The original post date was Friday. When we pushed back A3 due to midterm pressure, everything got pushed back a few days, and that has made A4 tight.  \n\nI'm expecting A4 will be posted early this week -- probably after the labs tomorrow -- but it depends on how exam creation and A3 automarking go.
