[quote]What kind of questions can we ask our TAs?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nThe TAs signed up for the job because they want to help other students. Please go to lab, and please ask them for help when you need it!\n\nThey will answer any course-related question (short of "is this the right answer for my assignment?"). However, I've asked them to prioritize questions about the lab. If there aren't any questions about the lab, they can help with PCRS or respond to questions about the assignment. They may, however, redirect you to the discussion board if you ask a question about the assignment that relies on my interpretation of the assignment guidelines.</p>
