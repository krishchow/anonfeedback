[quote]Could y post the answers to the concept test questions, especially the answers to the questions relating to complexity. Complexity is a tricky topic. It would be a great help for tests! Also, not all of the slides in my section are posted like the worksheet on types of test cases (zero boundary etc). Could y please make sure all the material is posted in every section.[/quote]

<p>\n\n[url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=4045&pid=12296#pid12296]Sorry, no. I cannot post answers to the concept tests.[/url] Any of us would be happy to review them with you in office hours (or lab), as you have questions.\n\nPlease speak to your instructor, in particular, if you believe that material is missing. The materials aren't quite the same from lecture to lecture, as we sometimes cover different examples.</p>
