[quote]Do we just have to do odd exercises like last week?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nFirst, an aside: this is a question, and it really should go on the discussion board. More people will see it there. Also, I'll answer it faster. I check the discussion board regularly, but anonymous feedback goes into my email (along with everything else), so it can take 1-3 days to get a response.  \n\nSecond: while I try to post odd numbered questions, since there are solutions available, that's not always possible. This week, I suggested doing a range that includes even numbered questions.</p>
