[quote]for python in 108/148 and java in 207, how come we didn't have to deal with all these memory related things as much as 209? is it because of the course or the language itself?[/quote]
<!-- more -->
<p>\n\nWell, both. The course is about programming at the system level, and one of the system resources that has to managed is memory -- so we focus on it. In order to have more direct access to memory (among other things), we chose to use the language C, which, unlike Python or Java, allows the programmer to manipulate memory addresses. (Java and Python provide the programmer with "references" to objects that cannot be mutated.)  \n\nSo: it's the language, but we chose the language because of the course.</p>
