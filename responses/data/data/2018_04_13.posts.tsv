Also is it a good idea to attend class while on the wait list? Thank you.[/quote]\n\nNo, there won't be another lecture section opening. I believe they'll be adding some slots to the existing lectures. However, since the campus has been closed for the past two weeks, nothing has changed since right before the holidays. I'd expect to see some changes in the next day or so.\n\nIn the meantime, yes, I'd attend the lecture if you're on the waitlist.	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	0	0	1

Even Dan gave us a whole week to do 1 question preliminary in CSC236. It doesn't make sense to have 3 questions ..."[/quote]\n\nThere's definitely a difference between work done within class and work done outside of class. The key difference is: having a quiz in class means you must prepare for the breadth of material covered each week. If you have the question ahead of time, it's easy to just prepare for that one question.  \n\nThat being said: the goal isn't to have time pressure. Each of the last few quizzes have been 9-10 minutes (not 5). You can expect about that amount of time for the next few quizzes, as well, but if I see a large fraction of the class still working, I'll extend the time. I haven't seen evidence of time pressure on the last two quizzes that we've marked, however. \n\nThe fact that the last few quizzes have had 3 questions is a bit of an anomaly. I'll always try to have multiple components to mark, but that might mean having 1 question with 3 parts, 2 questions, or even 6 questions. I put questions on the quiz that hit important topics that I want us to discuss; I make sure that I can do the quiz in ~2 minutes total.\n\n[quote]there is no point in having 2 weeks of material on 1 quiz no matter how simple it the last question is. We already have enough to do for this course in terms of reading and especially labs.“[/quote]\n\nThe quizzes have two goals: first, to test you on material we have covered thoroughly, to provide fast feedback. Second, to make sure you are prepared for the next week. You should be covering about one week of content each week, with your time split between reviewing the previous week's material and checking your high-level understanding of the new material.  \n\n[i]How much time?[/i] I'm expecting roughly 2x your contact time outside of class. You get ~3 hours of contact time, as the university counts it. (Lecture counts as one. Labs always count as one, no matter what the length.) That means I'm pacing the content to be doable in 6 hours outside of class. (That makes a 5 class load a full time job -- 45 hours per week or so.)\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] title	142.1.7.71	-1912535225	0	0	15	1422291097	1

Hence, I don't think we'll be successful getting a new TA for the course. Instead, I’ve asked the TA scheduled to work the second half of the term if he can start early -- and I'll shift some of responsibilities off of grading and onto lab contact.\n\nThat’s not a full-term fix, since we'll be back down to two TAs in the lab starting in week 8, when we start assembly programming. However, the assembly labs probably don’t need (historically haven't needed) as much support as the ones that use Quartus, so I think two TAs will be sufficient.

All the prior questions 1a,1b explicitly asked us to refer to the circuit. 1c had no such thing, hence I decided to only use what was given to me in the question, even though I knew that the contamination was not the most correct answer to use in my formula. I made the assumption that propagation was equal to contamination since we were not given it otherwise or told to refer to the circuit. [/quote]\n\nI'll keep an eye on this when we mark the quizzes late this week. However, at first glance, I don't follow your argument. The subquestion is structured the previous two: it presents contextual data and then asks, "What is the maximum clock frequency [b]for this circuit[/b]?"\n\n[b]addendum:[/b] [quote=Anonymous]... I also had the same feeling when you took it up! I think what the OP was getting at was that you never told us to refer to the "combinational circuit".

I think I get what you're saying -- but in that case, I think it's fair to mark it as a deduction. Computing a clock frequency requires a schematic. You need to know what circuit is being clocked; just knowing some attributes of a flip-flop doesn't tell you how those devices are being used.	142.1.7.71	-1912535225	0	0	15	1424752631	1

Just because they get a 4.0 in the class doesn't mean they are TA material. We're paying for top education, I shouldn't be taught by someone who has the same experience as me. ... I like how 258 TAs seem to be grad or PhDs 10/10 for you. They are actually helpful.[/quote]\n\nFor full disclosure: we have three TAs for CSC258, and one is an undergraduate. \n\nYour point is well taken. I agree that there are times when placing undergraduates in TA positions isn't appropriate or effective, but I also think there are times when undergraduates are more effective than their graduate counterparts. tldr: If you have a TA who is not effective, let your instructor know. However, we owe it to all of our students to give them opportunities that challenge them.\n\nThe issue has a number of facets:\n1) [b]There are not enough graduate students who want to TA.[/b] In the past few years, undergraduate CS programs (including ours and downtown's) have grown very rapidly, and the graduate programs have not. That means there are not enough graduate students to cover all of the positions we advertise. Note: if a graduate student is qualified for a position, they are [i]always[/i] offered the position before a qualified undergrad.\n\n2) [b]Undergraduates have attributes graduates don't have.[/b] This argument is mainly relevant for 108/148. I personally prefer undergraduates to graduates in these courses, because the main role of the TAs are to be role models. They're demonstrating what it means to be successful in an undergrad computer science program.\n\n3) [b]We owe quality educational experiences to all of our students.[/b] Yes, that means the TAs should be qualified -- and if you have a TA who doesn't know the material or who isn't spending the time necessary to prepare appropriately, you need to tell someone. The instructor of a course is a good start. However, that also means that we need to offer challenges to students who are excelling. Being a TA is also an educational experience, and it is one that we offer to students who have distinguished themselves. Teaching the material puts it in a new perspective, and TAs often find that they learn the material in a much more deep way by TAing.\n\nBeyond this discussion about TAs, the phrase "we're paying for a top education" interests me. Not to put you on the spot (whoever you are), but it indicates a consumerist perspective on the issue, and in my opinion, while that's one valid perspective, it has some problems. First: you're paying, but you're not actually paying full value (yay taxes!), so you have (unvoiced) obligations to society and, in particular, your community. Second: that outlook has the potential to trivialize the educational experience as an exchange (money for education), rather than as an opportunity.	70.54.64.138	1177960586	0	0	0	0	1

If you'd prefer, you could talk to Arnold Rosenbloom, the faculty advisor, instead.  \n\nIn short: We offer enough courses that any student can graduate using only UTM courses (going to StG is not necessary), but many students take at least one course downtown, because there are more choices on that campus.  Some students take a majority of their fourth year downtown, either because they find it easier to manage their schedule in one location or because they want to focus on courses that UTM doesn't offer. I'd ask your upper year colleagues, just to get a sense of what they do and what courses they tend to take downtown.	142.1.4.213	-1912535851	0	0	0	0	1

Also, people are probably going to cr/ncr and not study and make the average even lower. Are you going to make the exam harder now?[/quote]\n\nNo offense, but this kind of question annoys me. Reading it uncharitably, I see, "I care more about grades ('low average') than learning or anything else."  Another possible reading is, "I don't really trust you. Are you diabolical and mean?"\n\nSo:\n1) No, 258 this term doesn't have a course average that is out of line from previous offerings.\n\n2) My goal with the exam is to evaluate your understanding of the key concepts in the class -- the concepts that you'll see in later classes in the program and/or that can be applied to areas outside of hardware design. The difficulty of the exam isn't influenced by factors outside the class; it's influenced by my learning objectives for the course.\n\nAll that being said, I'm not particularly concerned by the course average. I'm more concerned about maintaining a standard of learning. I would be delighted if everyone rocked the final exam and the course average was a high B. I'd leave it there -- no modifications, no "curving". I'd be sad if no one studied for the exam and the class average became an F. Similarly, I'd leave it there. No modifications, no curving. My point is: you'll get what you earn. \n\nMore practically, the exam will look a lot like the quizzes and the midterm. I'm pulling all of the questions out of the exercises I've posted, the questions in the reading guide, and the labs.	142.1.4.213	-1912535851	0	0	0	0	1

How do they store data while doing logic?[/quote]\n\nI'm not sure that I know what you're referring to. I'm guessing you're asking about memristers -- fairly newly developed circuit elements that could be used as non-volatile memory. A memrister is a device which has a variable resistance. The resistance changes depending on how much current has been applied in the past -- and which direction the current flowed. By testing the resistance, you can determine the charge that flowed, and that lets you use it as storage. However, as far as I know, they aren't being used to perform logical operations.	70.54.72.165	1177962661	0	0	0	0	1

Do you know which CS professors prefer to be called by their first name rather than "Dr. X" or "Prof X"?[/quote]\n\nThere isn't going to be a hard and fast rule. Various faculty will have different preferences. I suspect, for example, that Dan Zingaro and Arnold Rosenbloom wouldn't mind you using their first names -- but I don't know for sure. (Ask.) Daniel Wigdor, on the other hand, would probably prefer that you use Dr. or Professor Wigdor. In most cases, I'm happy with either Prof. Petersen or Andrew -- but I eventually insist that students who are working with me closely (an independent study or over multiple terms) use my first name.  \n\nIf you'd rather not ask, it's always safe -- in this department or others -- to refer to a faculty member as Professor. That being said, using the title Professor as a general title isn't formally correct -- you're using it as a courtesy title. Formally, the title only applies to full Professors -- very senior faculty (and at U of T, only those in the research stream). The teaching faculty, for example, are titled lecturers (not technically professors) -- though that changes as of July 1, and more junior faculty are usually Associate or Assistant Professors. That being said, I don't think it will offend the person you're speaking to if you use a courtesy title for them, and I've never heard anyone referred to as "Associate Professor X" in informal conversation.\n\nI wouldn't use "Dr." unless you know the faculty member you're talking to holds a doctorate (Ph.D. or equivalent). It's never used as a courtesy title -- always as a badge of achievement -- and some faculty don't hold doctorates. I don't, for example, and neither does Arnold Rosenbloom. Beyond that, I think that in North America, it's generally held that Professor is more prestigious. In Europe, on the other hand, some people would prefer "Professor Doctor", since many Doctors are not Professors and some Professors do not hold Doctorates.  \n\nAs an aside, I have a colleague who holds two Ph.D.'s. I sometimes call him Dr. ______, Ph.D., Ph.D. I don't actually recommend that. It only really works as a joke.	70.54.72.165	1177962661	0	0	0	0	1	
9336	2804	8154	148	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1428678252	[quote=Anonymous]Just got this question in mind. Do professors have any stake in success or failure of a student in a course?[/quote]\n\nThere's an emotional investment: no one likes to see someone fail, and it's harder the better you know a student. But in terms of some compelling interest -- like being evaluated on the performance of a student -- no, I don't think we have a stake in any [i]individual's[/i] performance [i]in a course[/i].  \n\nWe often do have a significant stake in an individual's success or failure [i]outside of a course[/i]. If, for example, I work with a student extensively, then their success or failure is partially a reflection on me. This situation is most obvious in graduate studies. (Faculty are often judged on the success of their Ph.D. students.) However, it also applies to reference letters: if I write someone a strong reference letter, then the student's success or failure in that opportunity will make it more or less likely for others to believe my references. \n\nWe also have a compelling interest if you consider [i]everyone in the course in aggregate[/i]. A faculty's job performance is partially assessed on his/her ability to deliver successful learning opportunities. If an entire class of students were to succeed or fail in some measurable way, then that faculty member's standing would be affected.	142.1.4.213	-1912535851	0	0	0	0	1

They've been built over several terms by various instructors, but the original instructor to use concepttests at UTM, Dan Zingaro, doesn't want answers posted.\n\n2) Beyond that, I agree with his reasons for not posting answers: reading an answer is different, in terms of support for learning, from choosing (committing to) an answer. The former doesn't require that you actively formulate an answer, and the latter does. If we post the answers, it suggests that just knowing the answer to that particular question is important, and that's not it. We want you to be able to figure out the answer for a whole set of related questions.\n\nAll that being said: you should be able to check your answer on almost every question, because the question is about code.

That being said, I'm disappointed that we won't be able to run one section on computers. I agree that it's more natural for programming tests to be on a machine, where you have been doing the majority of your work. However, it's logistically challenging to get our tests (and final exam) on the computer, and it's not [i]proven[/i] that there is benefit in doing so. \n\nWe were hoping, by running one section in a computer-based test and others on paper, that we would be able to collect evidence about the impact of a computer-based test on students and, simultaneously, that we would be developing the infrastructure necessary on this campus to run such tests. If we were able to demonstrate that students do far better  in a computer based environment, then we would have a stronger case for getting other units on campus to work with us to offer such tests. \n\nSo, to your question: would it have been unfair to have some students writing on paper and some on the computer? I don't know yet. I [i]think[/i] so. If I were to make a prediction, I would guess that about a quarter of students will do far worse on a computer-based test than on paper (since they are less likely to get partial credit), that about half will do better (by about one letter grade), and that one quarter will do neither better nor worse. To guard against that, our experimental setup included a normalization step: all students (computer-based or not) would have completed the first two questions (the short-answer questions) on paper. Then, we would have used results on those two questions to scale the results of the second question [i]up[/i] for whichever group (computer-based or paper-based) did worse. In essence: the mean on the second two questions would have been the same whether you wrote the test on paper or on the computer. It's not perfect, but I believe that is more likely to benefit students than it is to be detrimental to anyone.\n\nWhere does that leave us? I hope we'll be able to run this in future terms. The issue that terminated the experiment this term was the availability of the lab: computing services was unable to get the machines in CCT set up for today's test without significantly decreasing the availability of the lab for other courses that might need it today. After a meeting earlier this week, I think we now have a viable plan for getting the labs set up for our tests without disrupting other courses, so I'm hoping we'll be able to run this study in the winter term, with CSC148.	142.1.3.148	-1912536172	0	0	0	0	1

I think, if you're comfortable doing so, that a face-to-face conversation will help more than advice provided anonymously. The correct advice depends on your situation. For example:\n\n- How did you lose marks on the midterm? (Were the types of questions or amount of detail we asked for unfamiliar? That's fixable. Did you have trouble predicting what the result of code would be? That's potentially not fixable in the next few weeks.)  \n\n- You've been reaching out for extra help, which is good, but what are you doing when you're studying on your own? Are you re-watching videos? (That may not be effective.) Are you reading code, making judgements about what you expect to occur, and then testing those judgements? (That mirrors what we are asking you to do on the test -- and when you write code -- more closely.)\n\n- When you're doing the PCRS exercises, do you understand [i]why[/i] an answer is correct? If you're just happy to have found the correct answer, then that's not enough. We need to spend some time understanding how the machine works underneath, so we can predict what it will do for any given input.  \n\nIn short, it would be useful to talk, because as you noted, the final exam is really what sets your mark in this course. We need to make sure that you're spending your study time efficiently, on the kinds of things that will help you prepare for that exam.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

I must say that your teaching style is really good but it would be helpful if you could explain codes in a little more detail.[/quote]\n\nI'm very sorry to hear that you're having trouble with the course. I agree that students who have not studied computer science before will have more trouble than students who have experience with programming. It's the same with any skill: practice is important, and the longer you've had to practice, the better you'll get. However, I stand by initial assertion that this course is intended for students without experience. We've tried very hard to make sure that we're covering material "from the beginning" and that there are resources in place to practice. Students without experience have been successful in prior terms, and while this is anecdotal: a student without prior experience has been one of the top 3 marks [i]every year I have taught this course[/i]. (Yes, I ask. I'm curious.)\n\nSo here are the keys: you need time to practice, and you need help when you get stuck. The time to practice is up to you. (I expect it should take ~8 hours each week. In some weeks, a bit less. When assignments are due, significantly more.) Please, if you're having trouble, take advantage of the resources that are available. You're welcome to attend any lab (or the open TA hours that have been recently posted) to ask questions, and you're also welcome to attend any instructor's office hours. Granted: my office hours have been very busy this week, with A2 coming due and the midterms being returned, but I expect they'll get quiet again soon.\n\nIf you've run out of PCRS examples to practice, make sure you're working on the labs. You can also take a look at the additional exercises posted on the "references" page of the course website.\n\nRegarding the pace of the course: unfortunately, no, we can't slow down. This course is a prerequisite to later courses (CSC148 in particular, but also CSC207, 209 and third year courses, indirectly).  Those courses rely on us introducing specific material, so we have to make sure that material is covered. Again, if you need extra explanation, please come see someone in lab or office hours.	142.1.3.148	-1912536172	0	0	0	0	1

I don't think it's fair that an entry level computer programming course should have you trying to decipher and understand a concept (DNA) that has nothing to do with learning how to utilise the Python language. It felt like a cheap shot. The assignments should be simple to understand. The challenge and measuring of skill should come from how efficient our programs are and how neat our code is. Everyone I've talked to has felt the same way: the difficulty laid in finding out what the hell the descriptions were trying to say instead of not knowing what programming methods to use. Thanks for your time and I hope you take this feedback in to account going forward.[/quote]\n\nThanks for your feedback -- and I'm very sorry you're frustrated. However, I think that the difficulty you're experiencing is something we're building in intentionally.\n\nWhile learning to read and write syntactically correct Python is one goal of this course, it's not the only goal. Another (equally important, in my mind) is learning how to develop programs, and that includes working out what you're being asked to write -- whether or not you're familiar with the context of the problem. As a result, one of the goals of this class is to have you work through the process of understanding a problem. That involves reading descriptions of the problem, trying out possible interpretations, generating and validating examples, and eventually solving the problem in different ways.\n\nI suspect that you'll find A3 to be significantly more challenging -- and less specified -- than either A1 or A2. The key will be working through examples to develop an understanding of what is being asked for. If you run into problems (or as you encounter unspecified details), please post on the discussion board or drop into lab or office hours to get a pointer.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1478676242	1

13027	4045	11746	232	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1479012369	[quote]Thoughts on Assignment 2, feedback:\nAssignment 2, similar to assignment 1, did a good job at making one, as a student, think of a solution to the presented problem. I think the problems themselves, did not require an extensive background in the content of the problem, in this case, an understanding of DNA and biology. I thought that having two files as opposed to one file, was a nice change because it becomes a little bit easier to test and manage. However, this assignment was a bit harder than assignment 1, which is fine because its allows the student to continue building their skills in computer science as well as problem analysis. My only complaint about the assignment, is the lack of extra examples and explanation. I personally found that the clarification page on DNA, could of been more articulate regarding the topics. I also think that the DNA help page should have provided more than one example when explaining the core concept. Obviously, you shouldn't provide too many examples because then it takes away from our ability to inquire and think but there should be at least more than one example and they should be a bit unique. Perhaps 2 examples? Thank you for taking the time to read my response.  Best of luck to all[/quote]\n\nThanks for the feedback. I'll make a note about the DNA page for the next time this assignment (or a variant) is used.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

Infinite loop errors should be treated like any other error. It makes no sense to give the assignment a zero! and the assignments are very ambiguous in wording and the content is extremely difficult for first-year students.  i should have gotten above 92% if it werent for that infinite loop problem not doing the function would have given me a higher mark :{[/quote]\n\nUnfortunately, it's not that simple, since many of your functions should have called other functions. Beyond that, I don't think an infinite loop is equivalent to a failed test. I think it is far worse. An infinite loop leading to a timeout is an error equivalent to a syntax error in the file. It's a major error, because it makes the module unusable (or, at least, risky to use).\n\n[quote]For the people that got infinite loop in their test inputs. The max they can get is 80?[/quote]\n\nThe brief answer is: in almost all cases, yes, they *should* resubmit, and the max score on a resubmit is an 80.That being said, it might be possible for someone to score higher than 80, if they completed everything correctly except for the function with an infinite loop and if that function was not called by any other function.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1479014338	1

You get multiple sets of eyes on a specification and the code that implements it to make sure that the specification is correct and that the code implements it appropriately.\n\nIn our setting, the goal is to hear multiple perspectives on code that should be familiar. I'm hoping that you see that there are multiple correct ways to implement a function, that reasonable programmers can disagree about what they prefer, and that there are some obvious mistakes in your coding style that you can fix for the next assignment.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

13477	4045	11746	232	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1480445542	[quote]I am a first year student, and I am doing absolutely horrible in this course. I do not understand how PCRS is set up, but there was a very abrupt transition in difficulty occurring around week 4, and it has been continuously more difficult as the course goes on. The transition from answering the multiple choice questions in the Prepare, to actual programming problems in both the Perform and the Midterm is/was a huge leap. I understand we are suppose to attempt programming all throughout the course, and that attending the Labs should have also helped me, but solving some of these questions and assignments has taken me multiple days of trial and error. The videos and multiple choice are great for the basic procedures, but when it comes to solving most of the problems in Prepare, I usually resort to finding similar example questions online. The videos provide only one or two examples of some of the concepts, whereas the problems usually have a "gimmick" that requires using multiple other concepts that were never thoroughly taught (after looking at an unfinished programming problem, I am usually not able to accurately plan out my steps and proceed to solve the problem with little to no trial and error). The lectures I attend (MWF 5-6) feel as though they are teaching concepts that I should have learned a week prior (It seems counter intuitive to teach Bubble Sort during week 11, when I required a better understanding of it on week 10 for the Prepare and Perform). The Discussion Board is riddled with questions with the typical "figure it out for yourself" answer. I understand not all questions can be answered, the TA's and professors can not spend their entire day helping out everyone, and that there are many students in this program. But, I'd rather get a push in the right direction than nothing at all (At least provide a website link, tutorial video, or anything that could potentially help). There is very little hop!\n e that I will pass this course, even though I had some programming knowledge in High School and I was confident up until the first assignment (mark: around 60%) and the midterm (mark: around 30%). I hope someone at least considers this feedback for any future students that might end up going through a similar situations as me. [/quote]\n\nThank you for the honest feedback. I truly appreciate it.\n\nI agree that there's a pretty large gap between the first few weeks of exercises -- which are largely multiple choice -- and the weeks where we start writing code. This material was the first that we developed for a programming course. Since then, we've built material for C (and are working on Java), and as a result, the tools have gotten better. We're now able to hide and block code, which makes it easier to present very small, focused programming exercises to students. We'll be revisiting the 108 material next summer, and I expect one of the things that will be done be the creation of a number of smaller code writing exercises to get students writing code earlier in the term.\n\nI think, however, that I have a very different perspective than you on the type of answers provided on the board. Would you mind providing a link (or two) to responses that you find particularly unhelpful or representative of the "figure it out for yourself" response that you find isn't useful? \n\nFrom my perspective, one of the desired outcomes of the course is for students to be extracting meaning -- requirements, for example -- from descriptions of functionality. As a result, when possible, I have avoided providing direct answers and have been copying and pasting key elements of the specification, when possible, to help students identify what they should focus on. In my experience, simply saying "do this" isn't as useful, long-term, as saying, "This kind of phrase is important. What does it mean?"\n\nFinally, one piece of important advice: if you think you are going to fail this course, I strongly recommend that you come in to talk to me about your options. Taking a fail -- a 0 in the course -- is not a good idea. To give you an idea of why:\n\n[code]>>> 4.0 * 20\n80.0\n>>> _ / 20.5\n3.902439024390244[/code]\n\nLet's say that you graduate with exactly 20 credits and earn a 4.0 on every credit. That's 80 GPA points. But let's say that you also took this course once and failed it (got a 0). As a result, you actually have 20.5 attempted credits. Your final GPA will be 3.9. That 0 costs you .1 on your CGPA.  \n\nThat's not, by itself, huge, but it adds up. A couple of 0's -- or a couple of low grades in one term -- can quickly put you into trouble. So, please: if you have a good chance of passing this course, by all means, let's finish it out. But if you think you have no hope, let's talk and see if there's something you can do over the next week. If not, then it might be a wise decision to drop the course (with an LWD). Before you drop, you should talk to me or an academic counselor, but it is an important option.	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	0	0	1

But you've asked, so here are some comments and [b]opinions[/b] as a citizen and community member, rather than as an expert. \n\n1) People frequently misspell my name. (As a result, some email intended for me goes to "Andrew Peterson", a former student who doesn't want my mail. He stopped talking to me a few years ago.) I'm fairly used to this. However, it baffles me how people can decide to send mail to "Jordan Peterson" a professor of psychology at Scarborough and end up sending it to "Andrew Petersen" in computer science at Mississauga.  In any case, if the mail I've received (in proxy for him) is any indication, people are quite hateful. I find this particular method of objecting to be distasteful and disgraceful.\n\n2) Freedom of speech and, more specifically, academic freedoms for faculty are extremely important to me. However, these freedoms are, in specific situations, limited, and I agree with many of the situations in which these rights are limited. In this particular case, neither the situation being debated nor the context in which the discussion is occurring are straightforward. As a result, I am pleased that the university has allowed the conversation -- and protests, and counter-protests, and counter-counter-protests -- to occur. \n\nHowever, while I appreciate -- and fully support -- the rights of the people involved (Peterson, Peet, and others) to have this discussion and [i]also[/i] to object to what is being said in the discussion, I find some of the arguments and actions used to be inappropriate and unconvincing. I've mentioned one example above.\n\n3) Regarding the topic itself: I do not, on the whole, find myself swayed by the argument that Peterson has made. In particular, I am inclined to believe -- without, again, having sufficient background to provide a well-grounded opinion -- that Peterson has missed important details about the process to be used to enforce the statute that undermine his argument. He is not a legal scholar, though he can claim expertise in some aspects of the situation being legislated, and the legal scholars who have commented on this topic, while split on some issues, appear to have largely dismissed his claims.	128.100.27.26	-2140923110	0	0	0	0	1

That's a fairly significant penalty, since scholarships and the like often depend on CGPA. Admission into a program of study is also often based on CGPA. However, it's not the end of the world if you have one or two bad grades.\n\nHowever, if you fail a number of courses -- or have very low marks in most of your courses -- you could drop below a key threshold.

13967	4045	11746	232	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1481648317	[quote]what are the consequences of calling out an instructor on the internet? [/quote]\n\nNow that's an interesting question. I'm going to assume that you're talking about airing a complaint or concern about teaching or a professor's behaviour.\n\nIf you're truly anonymous, there is unlikely to be any consequence to you. There's also unlikely to be any consequences for the instructor (and they may not even know what you've done). For any serious change to occur, someone has to step forward and make a complaint through the right channels, and that complaint needs to be backed up by evidence.  \n\nIf you're not anonymous, then there still isn't likely to be many consequences for the instructor. Internet ratings are not very trustworthy, so their peers probably won't take any notice of them. The university won't take notice of it unless there's a complaint filed directly with them (again, with evidence supporting the complaint.) However, there may well be consequences for you. Whenever you put your name on something, it changes people's perceptions of you. So if you decide to go this route (and I assume you're asking for yourself), then please be professional about what you write. Ranting on the internet isn't a good look, and it could show up in a google search at the worst possible times. (Applying for a scholarship? Someone checks your name and finds ... Looking for a job? Are you level-headed and ready for responsibility? They look up your name and ...)\n\nSo, if you have a serious concern, I recommend (a) taking it to the professor first (if you're comfortable), (b) taking it to the department chair (if you're worried about the professor not handling criticism appropriately), or (c) approach the university's ombudsperson for advice (they will hold your concerns in confidence and will provide advice) or, if you prefer, visit UTMSU (as they are your elected representatives). In all of those situations: do try to be professional and make sure you have evidence of your allegations.	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	0	0	1

In particular, it talks about what we'll evaluate if you apply to a CSC POSt as a second year student. My advice to students who don't meet the requirements for the major is usually to apply to the CSC minor, as that will allow you to continue your studies. If you do well in the second year CSC courses, then you can enter the major after your second year. \n\nThat being said, a low mark in a required course is a warning: something is not working well. That suggests that later courses will also be challenging, so please take the time to reflect on your experience. If there are things that kept you from doing well in MAT102 -- gaps in experience, bad study habits, financial stress, or anything else -- try to name it and come up with a plan so that it won't get in your way next time. If things do not go well in the second year CSC courses, then you will not be able to (easily) continue on into the major.\n\nI don't have statistics on the past few years at hand. We generally look only at CGPA (the cutoff at UTM last year was 2.6, but it will go up this year) and whether or not the students met the minimum requirements for the required courses. Hence, I don't know what averages in MAT102 or other courses have been for the past few years.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1482600046	1

If there's a question you're having trouble understanding, please don't hesitate to post a question about it on the board. Don't spend time beating your head against it. If you're stuck, post it and move on. You can try it with a clear head (and more information) later in the week.\n\nI'd also welcome suggestions for how to improve the wording of the questions. We share these resources with the downtown instructors, so if you send me a problem that you think is difficult to understand (as well as a suggested wording), I'll put it into a list for review with the other instructors.

14430	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1485286404	Thanks to everyone who sent me some feedback on the summarization problems! \n\nThe response was generally negative (feedback copied below, with some comments inline), which I'm taking to mean that I need to think about how to motivate the type of problem or to evaluate it more effectively (so that people don't spend time hunting for keywords). That's assuming, of course, that there is an effect. I won't pull the data until the semester ends, but I will be looking to see whether there was an impact on performance in the very short term (on the questions at the end of the exercise) and further out (on the midterm or final review). If you're interested in the results, let me know, and I'll mail you after we finish the analysis.\n\n[quote]The summaries for the preparation on dynamic memory seemed a bit counterintuitive - we receive a perfect for providing a response between 100 and 250 words, in addition to using certain keywords determined relevant in our responses - criteria that determines our understanding of a topic that might not match our own. For example: what if we can summarize our understanding in less words? What if we do not feel it necessary to create summaries/notes for all the topics as some are easier to understand than others?[/quote]\n\nI agree that the lengths are arbitrary. Thanks!\n\n[quote]This got a 4/4\n\nstrcpy strncpy Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec tristique sagittis enim, aliquet eleifend orci pretium vitae.

However, I wish you had thought about what those keywords mean and how they relate to teach other, but that's your choice. The point of the "summarization" activity is that it asks your brain to build connections between ideas: to compare and contrast, to link related topics, to categorize, etc. By deciding to just pick out important words, you're declining to participate in an activity that I think will beneficial to you in the long run.\n\nBut in the end, how you choose to spend your time is your choice. It's my job to give you material and opportunities. It's your job to take those opportunities ... or not.\n\n[quote]It was a great weekend. I had a great time studying at a good pace until I started the Week 4 prep. More specifically, and sadly, the summaries. Doing the summaries makes me not want to do the other exercises.

Well, no more this term. This was a one week experiment.  \n\n[quote]None of my friends like writing summaries. I thought it was annoying, too. It made me go back and read the transcript.

At least for me, I don&#x27;t remember what I hear, I remember what I do. [/quote]\n\nIt wasn't a coincidence, but it also wasn't a particularly important connection. We just needed a task and found inspiration.\n\nI hear you. I think the issue that coding teaches a set of skills -- but doesn't necessarily reinforce concepts. The idea that malloc allocates memory on the heap and returns a void pointer -- so we get to apply whatever format we like to that space -- is important, but where does that show up in code? I can ask you to demonstrate that you can use malloc, but I can't ask you to explain what it does, and both are important.	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	0	0	1

It's a minor thing but I find it easier and faster to type variables and functions with the first naming convention.[/quote]\n\nCamelCase is generally not found in C or C++ libraries: it's not the convention that is used. UPPERCASE is used for constants, and pothole case tends to be used for functions. (You'll also see lowercase concatenated, like strncat. Pothole is more common with C++.)\n\nThe exception is types: you'll sometimes see CamelCase used to name structs or things that are typedef'd. (I think the GTK+ standard does this.) \n\nSo, bottom line: we don't always get to choose our conventions. We might prefer one or another (I tend to prefer pothole, for what it's worth), but we should generally accommodate the conventions of the group we're working in or the tools we are working with.	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	0	0	1	
14435	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1485287380	[quote]PCRS is really an amazing idea. It really does allow students to get a greater understading of the material.\n\nI think that most students don't know that PCRS is a UofT system, developed by students and faculty of UofT.\n\nThat being said, how can current students get involved with projects like this? Where can students find information about opportunities like this?\n\nI look forward to your response on the forum.[/quote]\n\nThat's kind of you.  \n\nSo, some opportunities are advertised on the discussion board (or on the board outside Petersen's office). For example, I expect to post a summer development opportunity in the next week or so. We're looking for 2 developers to build software tools for a self-paced version of CSC108 and an online stats course.  (That's how PCRS was developed a few years ago.) \n\nOther opportunities are course-based. There will be an announcement about the Research Opportunity Program (ROP) in early February. These courses offer the chance to work with a faculty member on a research project for a full year. Dan Zingaro and I both post opportunities most years, and we have a pretty good record about getting publications with our students.  \n\nIndependent study courses, in contrast, tend to be student-driven. Instead of a faculty member advertising a position, a student will ask about an opportunity to work on a project on a specific topic. You need to be known by the faculty in the department to make one of these happen in third/fourth year. So, ask good questions on the boards, get involved in MCSS and in TAing, and drop by office hours to ask questions and to share your interests. That way, we know whether we want to work with you (or not) when you submit a proposal for a project.\n\nAlso, Dan Zingaro and I run a research reading group each term. This term, about eight of us (six undergrad and two faculty, usually) are meeting on Fridays at noon to discuss recent research in computer science education. You may not be interested in this research area, but you're still welcome to join us, if only to practice reading research literature. If you [i]are[/i] interested in CS education as a project domain, then this is also a good way to build a foundation for a future research project.\n\nThanks for the question!	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	0	0	1

14697	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1485708438	[quote]For future assignments, it would be helpful if there was a post pinned to the discussion board that list frequently asked questions and answers, as well as updates to any part of the assignment that you think we should be aware of (for example treatment of new line as a character). Not only might this reduce repeated questions, it would also help make sure students don't miss something important because the question was lost in an endless amount of threads.[/quote]\n\nThank you. \n\nI like this suggestion, in terms of reducing clutter. \n\nHowever, I also dislike it, because it puts the onus on me to create a complete and correct FAQ, rather than placing the responsibility on the people in the class to filter through information and interpret it. This is related to why I generally dodge requests like, "Can you explain the assignment to me?" I'm happy to provide assistance when you run into problems, and I enjoy working with people who are doing the hard work of struggling with questions and building knowledge. However, I don't like packaging and repackaging tasks for people to digest. That work -- of reading, interpreting, and questioning -- is the process of learning, and it's not solely mine.  \n\nSo, to summarize: I am concerned that (a) some people will assume the FAQ is complete and correct if I curate it (while it may not be) and that (b) some people will read for specific answers, rather than learning from the many different questions that are being asked. So I'll think about this before the next assignment, but my initial inclination is to not personally curate a FAQ.\n\nThat being said, if you feel very strongly about this, I'd be happy if you were to implement it -- either individually or as a class. A jointly developed FAQ could be a very useful item, and it would reduce my concern about (a).\n\nAlso, a nitpick: I don't think that the treatment of '\\n' is an update to the assignment. It's a key idea: '\\n' is a character, and it's part of the input. It, like any other character -- whitespace or not -- is not special and should not be treated specially.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1485708579	1

[/quote]\n\nJust to be clear: it's a 20% deduction for a [i]resubmission[/i], not for a [i]remark[/i]. If you want me to review the marking, I'll do so. If it was our mistake, the mark will get changed. However, if your code has to be changed (resubmitted), then I'll apply the deduction. \n\nWhy?\n\nPrimarily, because marks are supposed to reflect performance. If someone submits something that doesn't work, I don't think it would be fair to give them a second chance and, potentially, to give them the same mark as someone who got it correct the first time. \n\nAnd sure, the thing they may have forgotten might seem minor, like adding "#include "hash_functions.c" to try to get a file to compile, but that's still an error: it reflects a misunderstanding of the use of include statements and the flexibility of separate compilation.\n\nSecondarily, because resubmissions take a lot of time to process. Marking all of the assignments at once takes a while, but there's an economy of scale: whether there are 5 or 500 submissions, my work is constant. Every remark, however, adds additional time, and that's non-negligible (10-15 minutes each?). If 10% of 209 were to ask for a resubmit, I'd spend a full day on that task.  \n\nSo, in my mind, adding a penalty to resubmissions strikes a balance between (1) allowing students to get some marks when there is a catastrophic error (like failure to compile or a timeout on a common input) and (2) deterring resubmissions for minor issues.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

Losing that weekend means that some students (including me) will not have any consistent or large amount of time during the weekday to truly work on the assignment and develop the questions that we could ask on the discussion board, this week's lecture and during office hours.

For 209, I [i]really[/i] need to be online, since the only timestamp that git really tracks is "commit time", and that can be faked on a local machine. So, for 209, about ten minutes after the deadline, I run a script to collect all repositories.

I'll review the marks, once everything is marked. \n\nHowever, here's my take: this is, at its core, a 148 assignment. It's a tree walk, and you've done those before. What makes this a 209 assignment is (a) the difficulty of working with raw memory (pointers) and (b) the need to learn about the various library and system calls using man pages and the internet. The former can be quite challenging, but there's nothing particularly new here.\n\nRegarding the lab: the labs are on Tuesday. We make the deadline Friday, so everyone has a chance to work on it a bit afterwards, but it's really just an administrative deadline. Similarly, after reading week, you'll have a lab on Tuesday, the midterm on Friday, and a lab deadline after the midterm on Friday night.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1487389021	1

It notes: "In a [b]long running program[/b], it is important to close descriptors that are no longer needed because the number of open file descriptors is limited, and it is possible to run out." That quote is speaking about the possibility of running out of file descriptors [i]within a process[/i] if you don't close them as you no longer needing them. Once the process terminates, all of the resources it is using (including memory and file descriptors) are released.\n\nAs an aside: It's possible to set both "hard" (set by the sys admin) and "soft" (set by the process itself, as a sort of error check) limits on the number of concurrently open files within a process. Hard limits are a security measure; they keep a process from maliciously taking over all of the file resources on a system. As a result, the OS is in no realistic danger of running out of file descriptors.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

It's really tedious and sometimes impossible to have to grade hundreds of assignments with crazy amounts of code. Still, I don't really agree with the auto marker system. To me, if a student understands 50% of a concept, they should get a 50%. If they understand 10%, they get a 10%. If they understand it all, they ace it. But with auto markers, it seems that even a student with 50% understanding will get a 0% or close to such. I may not understand how the auto markers work, but they don't seem AS accurate of an assessment to me as a human assessment would be. Hopefully I'm not coming off as angry, I'm honestly just trying to give my opinion on the system. Sorry if I come off as rude. [/quote]\n\nNo worries. You're not being rude at all.\n\nI think I'm hearing two concerns here: one about how automarkers evaluate code and one about how we assign marks. \n\n[quote] To me, if a student understands 50% of a concept, they should get a 50%. If they understand 10%, they get a 10%. If they understand it all, they ace it. But with auto markers, it seems that even a student with 50% understanding will get a 0% or close to such.[/quote]\n\nI don't think this is entirely an issue with automarkers: it's more an issue with how I set the marking scheme. That's related to personal beliefs about understanding and measuring understanding. Bear with me. This will take a few minutes ...\n\nSo, an automarker runs a series of tests and then assigns a mark based on an encoded marking scheme. The tests it runs are necessarily not comprehensive: we won't think to test everything. Also, the marking scheme suffers from the limitations of its developer. For example, if I don't think that anyone will make mistake X, then either (a) it won't be in the tests and hence, won't be evaluated or (b) all of the tests will require that functionality, so it'll cause students to get a zero. The latter is why we have resubmissions (and why we sometimes employ TAs to spot-check assignments and make sure the marking seems fair).  \n\nThere are also things we can't evaluate (easily ... or at all) using autotests. For example, I can't easily evaluate whether you're using a good design or not, and it's difficult for me to evaluate your coding style. There is some neat work in machine learning tackling this problem, by the way. I saw some work a few years ago that demonstrated that a properly trained expert system could grade essays more accurately than human graders. But that system is still a bit of a research tool.\n\nOn the other hand, a human grader will exercise some autonomy and will display flexibility. If they see a problem that wasn't covered in the tests, they can deduct for it. If they think the tests are being too harsh, they can provide part marks where an automarker would assign a 0. They can also apply complex criteria to evaluate somewhat subjective things, like code style. \n\nAs a result, human graders often provide higher marks than the grading scheme prescribes. I've seen one dramatic example in my own research. A few years ago, I started using a sequence of small, focused short answer questions ("Fill in the condition for this if statement that ...") in place of some larger programming problems ("Write a function that ..."). Grades [i]plummeted[/i]. Why? Because when the TAs were asked to mark a series of small things, they assigned each small question a 0, .5, or 1 -- and students rarely got it entirely correct. On the other hand, when they graded a large programming problem, they could assign any mark between 0 and 4, and they [i]actively looked for any reason to give part marks[/i]. So where a student might easily get a 0 or a 1 on a sequence of 4 1-point  questions, they would have gotten 1.5 or 2 on a larger question worth 4 points.  \n\nSo, which result is correct? Did the student deserve a 0 because they couldn't answer 4 tightly-focused questions? Or a 2 because they could write some code that looked kind of correct, even if it didn't actually answer the question at all? Now this becomes related again ...\n\n[quote] To me, if a student understands 50% of a concept, they should get a 50%. If they understand 10%, they get a 10%. If they understand it all, they ace it.[/quote]\n\nI have no idea how to actually evaluate understanding. I can't unscrew the back of your head, pour out what you "know," and measure it. As a result, 10% and 30% are, to me, indistinguishable. They're both low enough that if I were to ask you a series of questions, I'd probably conclude, "Nope, they don't get it." In the end, since I can't evaluate understanding, I have to evaluate outcomes: can you [i]do[/i] some task. If you can, then I conclude that you understand something. If you can't, then I have to conclude that you ... don't, or at least, not enough. If I ask a sequence of questions, I can start to approximate how well you understand something: if I ask 10 questions and you can answer 5 of them, then maybe you "half get it". \n\nThere's a related issue: consistency. One TA might assign the student a 2 on the large programming question, while another would assign a 1, and a third would assign a 2.5.  This is a huge problem, and it's difficult to fix. There have been times in the past where [i]every midterm I spot-check after a grading session has had an error in marking in it[/i]. Those errors in marking go both ways: points deducted when they shouldn't be, and points not deducted when they should. \n\nYour answers probably differ from mine, but here's my take on the questions raised in the last few paragraphs:\n\n1) [i]Should we be marking holistically or using focused, specific questions?[/i] In the context in which we were using the smaller, focused questions -- a first year programming course, where the desired outcome was the ability to use conditionals and loops -- I think they do a better job evaluating understanding than the more complex, integrative question. In a later year course, where the focus is on the design or the integration of components, I think I'd prefer a more holistic evaluation. But in the context of the example: I think the lower mark was more correct.\n\n2) [i]How big a deal is consistency?[/i] In a large class, consistency is very important. Within reason, I will exchange flexibility and even accuracy for consistency. That is: if I'm teaching 200+ students, I'd rather be "fair" than "correct" (to a point).\n\nAnd that, in ... a long screed, is why I use automarkers. The strength of an automarker is its consistency, and with a well-designed series of tests, you can try to get at specific pieces of functionality, rather than holistically evaluating the entire assignment. That doesn't mean that automarkers are all good. It's very easy to make a mistake with an automarker or to not factor in an important criteria into the marking scheme. That's why we have a a resubmission period and why we also have the TAs spot check the marking.\n\nThere are also things that the automarker can't mark, and as a result, the TAs will be heavily involved in the marking for A2. They'll be provided with the results of the automarker (and a rough assigned mark), and they'll be asked to spot check those results and also to fill in additional marks related to how the program was designed and how pointers were used.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

In particular, we think it's valuable that you have the chance to reuse code, because it might give you a sense of the kind of stylistic and design choices make it harder for you to understand and repurpose code you've written in the past.\n\nNow, let me got on my soapbox and preach a bit ... \n\nAlmost everything in a CSC course builds on previous material. Just because you leave 148 doesn't mean you can forget recursion, and getting past 236 doesn't mean that you can run screaming away from finite state machines and the idea of induction. \n\nAssignments are similar. Even when one assignment doesn't explicitly build on another, the latter assignment will almost always build on skills developed in the former -- and require perspectives and structures you've developed from the previous assignment. \n\nIf you have trouble with a topic in a course (or assignment), my advice is to spend some time polishing those skills and making sure you're ready to move on. Getting a bad grade isn't an opportunity to drop a topic and start fresh on the next course or assignment; it's a warning that you've missed something you're going to need.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

In most cases, I didn't find sitting down for a day or two before the tests to review material to be particularly helpful. Instead, I spent the bulk of my time and effort on the assignments and prep work. Then, a couple days before the test, I'd sit down with the syllabus and spend an hour constructing a story -- a narrative, or a map, if you prefer -- about the material. If I could see the connections between the material (what leads to what, what connects to what), then I usually found that I could pull up the relevant details, so I wouldn't bother to study. \n\nBut I did spend a lot of time on assignments and preparing for course. For me, the trick was to identify the essence of the assignment -- what made it difficult? interesting? -- and then collecting information about that topic until I felt "comfortable".

I'd review the readings provided by the instructor (although I usually didn't read cover to cover -- I just treated the readings like reference material), then work on the problem sets or, for writing courses, generate outlines and maps of related ideas. \n\nIf I encountered any problems while solving a problem set (or writing a program), then the primary task, for me, was finding ways to get insight into the problem. Looking back at it, that usually meant "generating tests." For a proof, I'd spend a lot of time [i]creating examples[/i] until I could see a pattern or relationship within or between examples. For a program, I'd spend time [i]creating example inputs and expected outputs[/i] (tests, except that sometimes the "outputs" were changes to internal variables) and then running the program through the debugger to make sure the variables in the program changed as I expected.	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	15	1487946769	1

[/quote]\n\nYes-ish.  \n\nYes, in that we've looked at how people answer PCRS questions. For 209, the majority click on a video. A few minutes later (but usually in less time than the video runs), they start submitting answers. It takes, on average, 2 tries to get the average question correct. However, there are also students who enumerate through questions (answering them without watching the videos, usually with no break between sections), and they tend to take a larger number of tries. And there are students who rapidly answer every question correctly on the first try. (It's a miracle ...) There is, of course, a massive spike in the number of students who work on PCRS within the 24 hours (and, in particular, the two hours) before it is due.  \n\nHowever, it's difficult to track how much time people spend without getting pretty invasive.

However, we also have to set a "session timeout" (30 seconds? 5 minutes? an hour?), so that students who work on a few questions and then step away (for a cell phone break, a class, or until the next day) don't inflate the time spent. We could get better data if we set trackers, as some sites do, but we don't do that -- and, in general, try to avoid invasive data collection. PCRS only tracks when you access an object and when (and what) you submit, and while instructors have access to course-wide analytics (how many people have completed this week's exercise? how many attempts, on average, did each question take?), they don't get individual student analytics at all. To get individual student data, you have to pull a grade report, or you have to dump the database and start pulling analytics out that aren't available through the PCRS UI. (And in case you're worried, the process for pulling the database dump is prescribed, and it includes a step to anonymize student records.)	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1488198032	1

But I was amazed by quality of answer you shared, so I decided to share some them here.[/quote]\nThat's kind of you. And also ironic, since I lost your feedback. \n\nI encourage you to come into office hours to ask these questions anyway; having a conversation, rather than a one-way data-dump, will be more informative. \n\n[quote]1. What do you (or CS department) expect CS students to do after they graduate?[/quote]\n\nI don't know that we "expect" any particular, specific path. Typically, we'll see a couple of students enter graduate school in computer science each year. (Often, they'll go to the U of T Ph.D. program, but we've also had students go to Ottawa, UBC, and U of T's professional masters program recently.)  Most students will go into industry, and they'll take a wide range of jobs: developer, tester, security analyst, support tech, financial analyst, etc. \n\nI think the path that is most surprising to me is finance. A relatively large fraction of the students I'm in touch with work at banks. Some are in security or dev teams, but others have gone into finance. Feel free to shoot me a LinkedIn request if you want to see what the alumni I know are doing.  \n\n[quote]2. Why do we have to study so much theoretical stuff(Eg. MAT102, CSC236, CSC263... CSC373...) I found other courses that are not meant to be theoretical(Eg. CSC343, CSC324) are still theory-heavy. Maybe UTM is not for me, but would these theoretical knowledge be useful in actual software workfield?[/quote]\n\nTake this answer with a huge grain of salt. Rosenbloom's answer will be very different from mine. But in my opinion ...\n\nWe're absolutely [i]not[/i] training you for the workforce. \n\nI mean, okay, we kind of are: we know most of you will be working in industry, and we know that many of you care about getting a job, so we'll motivate much of what we do with connections to industry. However, workforce training isn't, in my opinion, our primary goal: it's the carrot that we're using to get you interested. \n\nInstead, we want to get you thinking like a computer scientist. We want you to cultivate a certain set of perspectives and traits: a tendency to approach problems critically, to identify desired outcomes before beginning to design a solution, to get broad input (and feedback) from the people who will be impacted by the solution you're crafting, etc. \n\nThese traits aren't unique to computer scientists (or computer science), and they can be useful in a number of different situations. If you're anything like me, you'll apply these techniques to situations that have no connection to computer science. For example, I think I brought a unique perspective to the role of administrator of [i]a writing program[/i] (yes, really) because my impulse is to identify users (students and faculty), to identify desired outcomes, to evaluate the centre's operations based on those outcomes, and to use the evaluation data to optimize for the outcomes. \n\nThat was a work-based example, but I apply my training to other aspects of my life as well. And I hope that it makes me a more effective -- and productive -- member of society. And that, I think, is [i]my[/i] ultimate goal when teaching. I am not training you for a potential job in the workforce, and I think other faculty would agree with that position. My/our idealistic goal is to give you tools for contributing, in many different ways, to society. \n\n[quote]2. Why do we have to study so much theoretical stuff ...[/quote]\n\nI got a bit off-track. The theory is there because it builds a foundation. Partly, we're aiming to develop those perspectives and tendencies I talked about earlier -- and working through proofs, I think, makes you more methodical, more apt to identify edge cases, and generally more able to evaluate whether a strategy will apply to a particular problem. However, the content is also important. If you ever end up doing numerical analysis, graphics, or machine learning, linear algebra (MAT223) becomes important. If someone asks you whether a problem is solvable, CSC236 (and 363) become valuable. If someone tosses you a problem, CSC263 and CSC373 become important -- you might recognize that it's really just a graph problem, for example.\n\nI should also backtrack a bit and emphasize that we aren't unaware that you're going into the workforce. We're not unsympathetic. We do change the curriculum to better match what we think you'll end up doing. For example, we started teaching git instead of svn because git has become more common (but either way, we get to discuss version control and the idea that keeping copies of your work is important, which is what we really want to emphasize). However, because we don't know precisely what job(s) you'll end up taking, we don't know precisely what you'll need. Some of you will end up writing a lot of javascript in two years. Others will be writing in C#. Others won't be programming much at all but will be doing network architecture. We can't cover all of those technologies, so we try to get you ready to tackle whatever you run into.\n\nI had an alumni tell me once that when he got into the workforce, he got discouraged because he was less capable than his colleagues who had graduated from a technical college. They had worked specifically with Cisco and just flew through networking tasks that he didn't even know how to start. But five years later, he was managing them. He attributed that to the ability to pick up new ideas quickly, to communicate effectively, and to approach problems flexibly (rather than applying whatever tool was available).\n\n[quote]3. What was the biggest regret when you were undergrad? Is there anything we should do/try?[/quote]\n\nI didn't take every opportunity. I do regret that I coasted sometimes. Everyone needs downtime, and I don't regret taking bowling (yes, seriously) my last year. But if I could do it over again, I would take a few more upper year courses. I would take the intensive writing  and public speaking courses that I skipped out on. (I know you don't want to believe me there, but I can't emphasize enough how important communication is and how big a difference it can make.) I would take the extra stats courses. (I was a math-CS double major, but if I had to do it over again, I would be a stats-CS double major. I use stats almost every day.)	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1488528288	1

There wasn't any room for error although to be fair I don't know what the marking scheme is.[/quote]\n\nI tend to mark assignments and tests out of less points, rather than more, because I try to avoid having any item that TAs check be worth more than one point. Early in the test, I'll create a question that is being marked as a single item (the mark can be either 0 or 1), and then I'll scale the other questions to match. If a question takes a similar amount of time but has two items in it, the question will be worth 1 point but the two components will be marked as two half-points. If I think a question will take twice as much time, it'll be worth 2 points -- but that means it should have at least 2 components being marked in it.\n\n[quote]There didn't seem to be a lot of pointer and memory questions as advertised.[/quote]\nIt's 4-5 points on the marking scheme, depending on how you want to categorize the recursion question.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

It's really upsetting, hoping you can give some words of wisdom on that or some advice? Should we give different names on resumes, does that work? Honestly don't know what do think of this.[/quote]\n\nAs always ... read with a bit of skepticism. I'm not an expert in this area.\n\nBut I don't have to be an expert to be sorry you're encountering racism. I feel particular empathy if this is your first encounter with it. I vividly recall my own first, direct contact with racism -- and it occurred during university for me, as well. As a child, I was fortunate (or blind, or both).\n\nHowever, I enjoin you to remember this feeling in the future, when you encounter or witness others confronting barriers. \n\nIf you're Asian, you're relatively fortunate in this society. While you will encounter structural barriers, as the article you have cited demonstrates, the barriers faced by Asians are generally lower than those [url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=422902]faced by other minorities[/url] -- and in several studies of hiring practices I've seen, comparable or lower than [url=https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/newsroom/newsn/2700/new-research-proves-gender-bias-extraordinarily-prevalent-in-stem-careers]those faced by a majority: women[/url]. (The study you've linked is interesting in that it "averages" across both genders, rather than looking at each gender separately. It's also interesting that it didn't provide a broader range of Asian names -- southeast Asians were completely unrepresented -- and that it didn't try to differentiate between responses to the different subgroups that were studied.)\n\nSo: in my opinion, it's bad out there. But you might even have it better than most. And (again, in my opinion) nothing's going to change unless we face the implicit, structural barriers around us.\n\n[quote]Should we give different names on resumes, does that work?[/quote]\n\nI've heard this called "covering." Whether or not it works, we all do it to some extent. Whether you choose to cover various aspects of your identity is your decision, but I personally try not to. First, if I successfully cover, does this mean that I'll be "fortunate" enough to join a group that is hostile or, at least, unsupportive to some aspect of myself? And will that end up costing me, emotionally or otherwise? Second, if I feel the need to cover, will anything change? \n\nAlso, as an aside: Oreopoulos is a UTM professor, and he's running some studies at UTM that look at methods (primarily "coaching") for reducing attrition in the first year. It's interesting, to me, to see an economist applying his knowledge to such a wide range of subjects.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	15	1488864005	1

If you have evidence to support it, I'd appreciate seeing it.\n\nProf. Zingaro and I aren't unaware of the potential that a request for accommodation (for a midterm or assignment) could be false. There are, after all, unexplained increases in the incidence of the flu, food poisoning, and migraines whenever multiple assessments are due at the same time and whenever a test or exam is viewed as being particularly tough. \n\nHowever, to be fair to students who do encounter an emergency of some sort, we need to treat the requests we receive in good faith. As a matter of course, we assume that the requests we receive are legitimate. Then, we do our due diligence. I require that absences be declared on Acorn, I often ask the department's undergraduate counselor to spot-check medical notes by calling clinics, and this time, we'll cross-reference to make sure that students who missed one test actually missed both.	70.31.162.82	1176478290	0	0	0	0	1

I'm not sure if previous classes have done this; but I believe it's made (myself for sure) very reliant to just look things up on google or go back to look something up on PCRS to get the way on how to do a specific task and it's not sticking with me.\n\nDuring the midterm I was like, ah dang, if I saw this question in-class I'd just quickly google, "how do you malloc an entire struct?" again, rather than absorbing it if it was taught by someone..? If that makes sense. I feel like I just quickly look up what I need when I need it and forget about it afterwards, instead of sitting in a lecture and learning something.\n\nJust some thoughts and my 2 cents. It may not be that.[/quote]\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!\n\nIt could well be the structure of the course. However, the idea that lecture is superior to activities runs counter to a great deal of established work, so while I think it's perfectly fair to say, "This implementation of an inverted classroom isn't working!", I don't think we can confidently say, "Lecture is a better method for learning how to program." That result would be a surprise, and I'd need evidence before jumping to that conclusion.\n\nWe also have some local data. We've run CSC108 as an inverted course for a few years, and CSC209 has been run as an inverted course downtown. In both cases, we studied the courses.\n\nIn the CSC108 study, one potentially related observation is that [i]midterm marks were lower in the inverted course than in previous offerings[/i]. After doing some analysis, the authors (not me, but folks downtown) suggested that students simply submitted the problems and felt comfortable with the material -- i.e., that the exercises created a false sense of security. Then, they got hammered on the midterm. The good news [i]for that particular course[/i] is that [i]marks overall ended up better in the inverted course, and overall attrition was the same[/i]. Students who did less well on the midterm ended up doing very well on the final exam, and the authors attributed that to having the videos and other resources available, so they could "catch up". Take all that with a grain of salt -- there's a lot of speculation there.\n\nIn the inverted version of CSC209 that we studied, we didn't see a dip on the midterm. Overall marks in the course stayed relatively flat, but attrition (the number of drops) decreased. Again, take that with a grain of salt -- we're seeing a different pattern here.\n\nAll that being said ...\n\n[quote]During the midterm I was like, ah dang, if I saw this question in-class I'd just quickly google, "how do you malloc an entire struct?" again[/quote]\n\nThis seems like a key issue, and I'm glad you shared it. I'm guilty of using google to extract information -- it's a tool, and there is more information than we can memorize. However, I'd be very careful about the difference between googling terms ("What options does 'malloc' take?") versus actions ("How do I ...") The former is an attempt to augment your memory, so you don't have to memorize arguments, MACRO names, or flags. The latter is looking up a solution to a problem -- it's potentially short-circuiting the problem solving and design we're asking you to do. \n\nBut anyway. Either way, once you have a solution, please [b]pause, review what you've written, and reflect[/b] on what it is that you did that works. The "reflection" step helps with the storage of ideas. You can't rely on google for everything, and if you're just moving on as soon as something works, I'm not surprised that it's not sticking. Some things need to become automatic, and that takes effort to get them into memory.	142.1.4.228	-1912535836	0	0	0	0	1

This would be taking CSC236 at St.George since it does not appear to be offered at UTM over the summer. Alternatively is a really high mark in CSC148 and CSC108 (high 90s) sufficient if one is close to, but not over the requirement. [/quote]\n\nIf you haven't already seen the [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=4040]post about the last round of POSt evaluations[/url], check it out. We'll use the same process this year, with CGPA cut-offs updated.\n\nSo, in brief: A mark in 148 won't make up for a mark in 102, so you have to take some additional math/theory courses. Yes, I usually recommend that students who do not have the minimum marks for the major in the first year enroll in the minor and continue on to the second year, instead of retaking courses. The second year courses are required for the minor, so you're not losing time and, if things go well, we'll evaluate them instead of the first year courses when you apply for admission to the major in the second year. \n\nHowever, you should also do some reflection. \n\nFirst, why did the required courses in the first year not go well? Was it something transient, like an illness, or is it something about your approach to school, or is it something else? Either way, what can you do to make sure that the second year courses go better? It's not, in my experience, enough to say, "I'll just try harder." If you can identify a few concrete steps to take (setting aside space and time for studying, changing how you study, joining a study group, etc.), then you can have a better chance of getting admitted to the program.\n\nSecond, and this is even harder, what's your backup plan if you are not admitted in the second year? If you're unable to get the minimum scores in both the first and second years, it's unlikely that you'll be admitted in the third year, so what's a second minor that you can pick up to graduate with a major, CS minor, and ... ?\n\nFeel free to drop by my office hours to chat more.	184.146.27.73	-1198384311	0	0	0	0	1

And I guess this is not really anonymous is it?[/quote]\n\nI've occasionally used Google analytics to see when and how frequently people access specific course pages -- like assignments and labs. It's info for making decisions like "should this assignment deadline be extended?"\n\nTheoretically, if I had enough info about you, I could de-anonymize anonymous feedback. In particular, I'd need a mapping between your name and the IPs you tend to use. (Whenever you interact with a server, your info gets logged. For example, if I were the sys admin, I could figure out your IP from the web access logs. Then, if you used git from the same IP, I would be able to associate your user ID with your IP ... and then I could see what feedback you sent.) However, I'm not a sys admin on the system that hosts anon feedback, so I don't have access to the server logs, so it would be relatively difficult to figure out who you are.	184.146.27.73	-1198384311	0	0	15	1489906599	1

I'm pretty sure at some point you have thought about how an artificial intelligence would work or whether it is even possible, like every other computer scientist. What I would like to ask you is, do you think it is achievable and why?(And just to be perfectly clear, I'm not talking about just passing the Turing test but a fully functioning ai with at least a sort of conscious.)[/quote]\n\nI think so, and I think we (humans) are evidence. \n\nI think the turning point, for me, was watching [url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-computer-beat-the-go-master/]AlphaGo defeat Lee Sedol[/url]. I used to play go (weiqi, baduk) quite a bit, so I watched the games live and listened to the commentary of various pros. I had thought that a go playing computer was still 5+ years away from beating a pro on a full board, so I was as shocked as anyone. The story changed rapidly from "Will Lee Sedol sweep the series?" to "Can Lee Sedol win at all?"\n\nBut what was particularly interesting to me was how the commentators referred to AlphaGo and its play. Early on, they clearly referred to AlphaGo as a machine, later, they started using words like "brilliant" and "cunning" to describe its moves. Those are words that we typically reserve for "ideas" generated by humans.\n\nI'd seen something similar occur a decade earlier, with chess (but it didn't affect me as personally). At that time, it was interesting hearing grandmasters starting to describe the play of various computers as "aggressive" or "creative". They ascribed personalities to various programs, and that's my takeaway from watching these game-playing expert systems evolve: what we think of as personality, as brilliance, as independent thought ...: these, I personally believe, are words for describing decisions (computations) where we can see the result but not the logic being applied.\n\nAnyway.

17870	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1491157921	[quote]Just my two cents on the course and my experience of it.\n\nIt is just absolutely, insanely difficult of a course, to an introductory to systems control as well. While it would make sense that we would need to know of everything in the course over time, there is just too little time in the semester to learn and master everything that this course is asking for. Especially with other computer science courses and other courses asking for the same amount of devotion. \n\nThere is too many things! Too many man pages to learn how to use and what it does, too many things that the assignment is asking for, and too many things that the test cases can go wrong with (especially if you are looking for an extremely specific output). \n\nGranted, we are University students, and this is all to be expected but way too many things that could go wrong, went wrong. Midterm tests were at the same date as other important tests, doing assignments in general, having marks back late, or simply having a bad day can affect everything else like a stack of dominos. A1 was not bad, A2 was a huge leap, A3 had a lot of possibility of system problems such as infinite generation of folders or overwriting folders, and A4 is just a nightmare in general with how much of a difficulty spike sockets are in general.\n\nPersonally, however, I felt that the course could have possibly gone way better if we had less assignments to do (four assignments, with a3 and a4 both worth alot, back to back is just too much), but worth a lot more each. Another possibility is if we had the assignments as group assignments. This would lessen the load that a student would have to look up each about the man pages and would each lessen the workload of the assignment in general. It would make sense too, with a3 dealing with multiple sets of cases (file to file, file to directory, and directory to directory), and especially with a4 (one person doing mostly client, while the other the server, helping each other to make it work).\n\nOverall, I feel that this course is way too inclined toward those who have background information of C and the software. Those who did not have a prior information of C had a hard time understanding concepts or reading the man pages in general. (which is mandatory to understand the course!)\n[/quote]\n\nThanks for the feedback. I'll keep this to read before planning next year.  \n\nRegarding group assignments: downtown uses them in 209. It's partly a work-saving measure, since marking assignments takes a lot of TA time, but it's also an opportunity to have students practice their team work.\n\nUltimately, I decided not to use teams in 209 at UTM because of the common practice of "splitting the work." In a well functioning team, the work is split fairly evenly, everyone keeps up with what others are doing, and everyone ends up practicing the skills they need and learning the content. However, in some cases, work is spit unevenly, people do "what they're good at" instead of taking on work for practice, and there isn't time to learn the parts of the assignment that you didn't do. That would be (and at StG, has been) fairly disastrous in this course.	70.53.230.226	1177937634	0	0	0	0	1

Why couldn't it have been released while we are doing A3? Also, some of us didn't even need the A3 extension; we were almost done the assignment. At this very moment, some of us are considering doing a late withdrawal because of the time pressure and the bugs galore. I don't know anyone who is completely done this assignment, without any bugs in it.[/quote]\n\nFirst, let me be skeptical: the chances that you would have worked on A4 in that first week are ... small.  I grant that you [i]might[/i] have started, but most students won't have. Beyond that, the week 11 lab, which introduced key material for A4, was out and should have been completed before starting the assignment, so pushing the A3 deadline back from Wednesday to Friday wasn't significant. \n\nTo answer your question, though: it's a function of my time. I have a fixed amount of time each week to spend on this course, so I have to prioritize what I do. When an assignment is coming due, one of the highest priorities is answering student questions on the discussion board and by email. That can take 10-12 hours in a week that an assignment is due for a course of this size. Since there are also fixed commitments that have to be completed (preparing and attending lecture, running office hours, reviewing, editing, and posting PCRS exercises and the lab, etc), in weeks when assignments are due, there is little time for anything else. There isn't, without lots of prior planning, time to finalize the prep on an assignment and post it.\n\nI understand that you're expressing frustration with how difficult the last assignment is and how stressful the last few weeks of the term are, and I sympathize. However, I don't think that pushing the A4 posting date two days later is the major source of that stress. (Well, technically, it was a week later, but since I was out of town the week prior, I don't think the original A3 deadline was feasible.)	70.53.230.226	1177937634	0	0	15	1491158913	1

Find it completely unfair and unreasonable. [/quote]\n\nThere are two factors I considered before the term. One is selfish.\n\n1) So, selfishly: Late submissions (and in general, any "special case" like a deferred midterm) are logistically challenging. i.e., It takes significant time to track who has submitted what and to apply the policies.\n\nThere's also the issue of supporting students who are working past the deadline. [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=4649&pid=17874#pid17874]Another poster asked why we couldn't have A3 and A4 out at the same time[/url], and similar issues arise when allowing late submissions: you can't stop spending time on the discussion board, and that takes time away from other tasks.\n\nSo, it's a trade-off. In a large course, like CSC488 this term, I'll give students a few "grace day tokens," so they can manage their own deadlines and submit a few things late over the term. However, in a course the size of 209, I feel my time is better spent on things other than managing late submissions.\n\n2) More importantly: this course is challenging, and the deadlines are tight. If you fall behind on one assignment, then you're losing time on the next -- which uses the ideas from the previous assignment. This is a death-spiral, and I don't want to encourage it.  So, hard deadlines.	142.1.1.43	-1912536789	0	0	0	0	1

17930	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1491425001	[quote]I honestly don't agree with using test cases for a course like this. Like for example with A2, a lot of people that understand the core concepts of it (how to traverse a filesystem, opendir, readir, lstat, linked lists etc) still lost a lot of marks due to very small errors in their code. This is because test cases have to be EXACT, so either you get perfect or you get a fail. I wouldn't say that's an accurate assessment at ALL. This course should be about solving problems, understanding syscalls, using a unix environment, debugging big and confusing code with minimal time constraints, etc. It shouldn't be about being EXACTLY correct on your first try. That seems to go against how programming is generally done. I know marking code by reading through it is much more time consuming and difficult, but maybe like when you guys run your test cases, look at all the errors and actually see what went wrong. If it was a minuscule thing, you can still give part mar!\n ks based on how close the person was to the solution. I feel like leaving it on JUST test cases instead of human judgement is just wrong and results in inaccurate assessments. Also, I know you've said that you don't care about marks. I'm sure a lot of people, including myself, would agree with you. If it was possible to just go through university and learn what you';re passionate about without the worry of marks, I would gladly do that. But sadly, that's not how the world works, so we are forced to worry about petty things like marks. Sorry for the long rant, this isn't supposed to be an attack against you or anything, just my opinions on the course.[/quote]\n\nNo need to apologize. Thanks for sending the note!\n\nI think you and I agree completely about what this course should be about, and I'm glad you've had the chance to "debug big and confusing code" and to get familiar with syscalls. \n\nI also wish I could spend more time on each piece of feedback. Bluntly, though: this course is too big for that. I've already written a long statement about why I autotest, and I stand by it: I think that consistency is more important than precision in this particular course.

17931	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1491425339	[quote]I just want to say, i've really enjoyed the assignments in this course, as they've been quite challenging. However, something has been bugging me.\n\nYou seem to be having trouble marking the assignments. \n\nAn assignment that is assigned as early as A2, shouldn't have its marks delayed until AFTER THE COURSE HAS FINISHED. Looking at the feedback, you ran into issues with grading people's work, and ensuring the right marks are assigned. Even then, it's necessary for students to submit remark requests, to account for certain implementations of the file tree.\n\nIf you're having so much trouble with marking assignments, why don't you be more specific?\n\nSo many things are left "up to us", ie implement a tree with a dummy header in a2, or some other method. Yet we end up losing marks for having a dummy header implementation because your autograder doesn't take it into consideration.\n\nEven IF you do get your code right, the autograder might only give you 50% of what you deserve because you decided to do it differently (after all, certain things are "up to you"). And then you need to spend time writing up the remark request, explaining exactly HOW your code works (which might as well be a small written part of the assignment itself). This is kind of stressful to think about, seeing that it's during EXAM TIME that marks are finally coming out.\n\nI don't want to be thinking about the nitty gritty details of the assignment now. But that's what i'll have to do soon, when A3 and A4 marks come out, because your autograder will have missed SOME TEST CASE. I feel as if half our marks comes from doing the assignment, while the other half is fighting for it with remark requests. \n\nMy request is that in future courses, it will be specific about what is required. "Just follow what rsync does" doesn't cut it. The manpage for it is extremely complicated and even if we find something there that's even remotely similar to what is required for the assignment, it's unclear just how they are related. \n\nAs another example, if encountering a file to file situation in A3, you could specify to print an error.. Rather than something like "Print an error or attempt to replace the file. It's up to you", and then run into problems with the autograder not handling the different cases and deduct marks when we choose the incorrect option.\n\nAlso, for A2, if you could specify exactly ONE option as to how the tree should be built - whether it's using a dummy header or some other implementation - it would be easier on both the students, and you, who has to write an autograder for your assignments. By reducing the number of "cases", it makes it easier on yourself, and it makes it more clear to the student exactly what he/she has to do. Also, we get to have our marks back at an appropriate time. \n\nThank you for your time.[/quote]\n\nThanks for the beautiful bit of feedback. \n\nWe try to walk a pretty narrow line, and with A2, we didn't hit it. On one hand, we do, as you suggest, strive to make things testable. That's why A3 returned the number of processes (so we could easily test the number of [i]fork[/i] calls), for example, and why we have you split some functionality into specific, defined functions. \n\nOn the other hand, we also want to [i]leave more and more decisions to you[/i] the further you go in the program. In year one, we might tell the students to follow a very specific algorithm, but in year two, we want to start asking you to make decisions -- and then, to evaluate you on them. So when we say, "It's up to you," we don't actually mean, "And we don't care what you pick." We often do care. There are right and wrong answers and answers in between.  But we want you to choose what to do, and then we try to evaluate it.	142.1.1.43	-1912536789	0	0	0	0	1

This could be due in part to other courses also ramping up their difficulty (sockets were pretty difficult) and trying to juggle those. I would recommend if you could spend a bit more time on sockets and networking for next time. There are also some other things I want to say if you were to run this course next year.\n\nHold more office hours: this could be you, or a TA but I found that they were helpful, despite the carrot-leading.

I think there were some issues with how messages were delivered that caused problems, and I'll add some examples that reflect that next year. I think [i]select[/i] also drove people batty.  \n\nI'm unsure about office hours. I totally agree that they're useful, and I wish people would use them more.  But that's the problem: I would bet that, other than people picking up midterms, I saw no more than 20 different students, total, in office hours over the semester. \n\nI'm unsure what you mean by lecture slides.

Except in 209 for some reason, if you fully understood and were able to demonstrate and replicate 9 out of 10 puzzle pieces perfectly,  but the tenth piece you weren't able to formulate perfectly in your head. But, you did a moderate job. \n\nStill, that last puzzle piece! It didn't quite fit in the puzzle. And before you had a chance to fully grasp how that puzzle piece should be modified and reformed. A robot rolls by... wait... an  ugly, late, abomination of a robot rolls by and records your broken puzzle. And as it rolls away, you can't hear the motors turning.

But after meeting your ZEROBOT, that doesn't sound like such a bad idea. I'll even bring my own hammer and chisel. I agree, as long as the measuring cup is graduated. Because your bot certainly isn't.\n\nIn one of your posts you also said assigning a grade gets in the way of what's really important, learning the material. People in education love that little disingenuous tidbit. But I think that your inability to properly assign grades is what's taking the focus away from the material. Your puzzle is broken Andrew.

Is it helpful to have friends to work with or partner up with?

They -- or the transcripts below them, if you prefer to read -- convey an introduction to syntax and to some common issues you'll encounter as you write code, but they're just an introduction. You won't really "get it" until you try it, seg fault, look up the man pages, debug, bus error, seg fault, ask someone for a tip, rewrite, seg fault, debug, ... \n\nIt really is helpful to have people nearby that you can bounce ideas off of or ask for help on how to use a particular structure. It saves some time, if they've already done some looking around, and they are likely to have run into similar problems and might be able to give you a sense of where to start looking for the error you're currently facing. Working on it alone ... works, but in my experience, it's easy to hit a wall where I'm not sure what to do next, and then I just get frustrated. Having someone to bounce an idea of off gets you moving again.	128.100.27.26	-2140923110	0	0	0	0	1

You'll also get the common macros and structs related to those syscalls. What you do need to memorize is the typical way that syscalls return errors.	128.100.27.26	-2140923110	0	0	0	0	1

How come their deadline was on April 5th, 5 days after our official deadline? It goes to show that we’re being treated unfairly. We were already under pressure that we don’t have the benefits that students downtown have, and our time to work on A4 was cut short because of its late release, but our time was already short to begin with!\n\nSomeone did talk about why we can’t submit assignments late, you responded with the reason that it is “logistically challenging” and a trade off had to be made. Well how come the professor downtown is able to handle it then? They have more students to begin with. So it’s pretty hard for me unravel my head around why the policy couldn’t be implemented here. Whatever reason that you try to justify here, you cannot deny the fact that they have it while we don’t. That’s unfair!\n\nAs for working in groups, I don’t understand why you can’t implement that. You can reason that it serves as a learning experience to manage everything on our own, but once again, you cannot deny that the St. George students have the benefit to work in groups, while we don’t. You can reason that we are focused on the content that we’re learning rather than marks…but marks still matter in the sense that the course code for this course is identical in both campuses, ignoring the suffix. If the UTSG student didn’t know about the lack of benefits that we have, then those students will begin to ponder on, “Why are UTM students are doing worse than them even though the assignments are the same?” Our sense of pride there is undermined, even for the ones who really trying in the course. \n\nBesides…students not being able to work in groups contradict the statement you made before about late submissions, where you said, “I feel my time is better spent on things other than managing late submissions.” This gives the impression that time is a concern for you, and if that is the case, why not have us work in groups, so that you have less assignments to mark then? It’s a win-win situation. You have less assignments to mark, so that you have time for other things, while we get to have experience in working with other people, which you guys have encouraged us before in CSC290 and CSC207.\n\nAs for their deadline being on April 5th, why weren’t we given those additional 5 days? You first reasoned before that you don’t want students working while they are studying for our exams, but then why isn’t this a problem for the professors downtown then? It’s pretty much our problem in how we are managing our time to work on the assignment and studying for the exams. If we need more time to study for the exams, then we’ll just have to get as much done sooner than later. If you try to say that gaining a few extra days to work on the assignment is insignificant, like what you had said before about why wasn’t A4 released earlier, then I’m here to tell you that that’s not true. For A3, I was able to finish coding it within 2 days, and debugging it within 1 day. Altogether, I only needed 3 days to finish the assignment. Granted, I trapped myself at home for almost all this time, and focused solely on the assignment for hours, but I was able to effectively make use of time for the assignment. The extra few days that I was given were used up when I had to attend my classes and do other school work. So it goes to show that even if you give us an extra few days, it can really make an impact to the students’ performance.\n\nA4, uses everything we know in the course, that includes sockets, which is our first time working with networks. Given that C is a low-level language that uses the imperative paradigm, everything is prone to errors. We got many strange bugs and errors in our programs like “abort trap: 6”, “stack smashing error”, and some bugs just appear without any errors. It was incredibly frustrating for people, like me, who spend days working on this, and they soon realize that they have to redesign the whole thing. We really needed the extra time, especially since the last week is filled with deadlines for assignments for courses like CSC263, where their last problem set required a lot of thinking; and some people had essays due. Granted, that it’s not really up to your concern about the deadlines for other course work, but most people have work in other courses, so giving us extra time actually helps in allocating time to work on A4, without costing our performance in other assignments. \n\nBut since we were not given the extra time, we had to make some sacrifices such as: sleep, attending lectures, going outside, or staying in a course. Some people may have foreseen the fact that they couldn’t finish the assignment, so they didn’t bother finishing it and dropped out of the course entirely. Others, like myself, hate to give up and try their absolute hardest to get the work done even if it goes against our odds, and have reached to a point where we feel frustrated. We know that a bot is going to mark our code for the exact output, and if our code just breaks in the end, all our hard work have fallen in vein. In fact, I got super mad at myself; I tried my hardest to succeed but I failed. But then when I realized I have the UTSG students have benefits that I don’t have, then I got even more frustrated. Had I have known about this before, I would’ve taken the course downtown.\n\nAll in all, I believe that I have sufficiently shown that UTM students are not being treated on the same level as UTSG students in CSC209. People have told me that UTM is a part of UofT, so the same standard should apply everywhere in terms of workload and difficulty, but not in this case, I’m afraid. In fact, I haven’t even mentioned their course website; their website is much more appealing to our eyes than ours. Granted, not everyone cares about the websites’ aesthetics, but given the circumstance that I discussed before about how unfair that we are not getting the same benefits over the same assignments, this is not helping. In some sense, it makes me feel that they are favoured more.\n\nI’m sorry for making a long post, but I believe that it had to be done.[/quote]\n\nI think I've responded to questions about why I didn't allow groups and late submissions before, so I won't detail my reasons. Why it is done downtown, though: they use groups to cut down the marking load, with the understanding that students won't work on all of the assignment, and they allow late submissions because the decreased marking load (per TA) lets them use resources on the logistics of managing late submissions.\n\nRegarding due dates: I think you don't have all of the information correct. Their assignment was due 5 days after UTM because StG started a week after we did. Their last day of classes was yesterday, April 5. So their assignment was due on the last day, just as ours was.\n\nIf you look further back: All of the UTM assignments were due before StG. All of the UTM assignments were also posted before they were posted at StG, and you'll see small differences in the requirements in those assignments.\n\nBut beyond those issues: you're right that UTM isn't StG, in many ways. There are more faculty there, so there are more courses offered. There are more people there, so they get more recruiters. But if you're concerned about [i]pride[/i]: at UTM we strive to make sure that the students meet the same outcomes as students at StG, and we try to give you the tools to outperform them. \n\nFor several years, the top marks in CSC469 (advanced OS) were held by UTM students, because the systems students are strong here. So if you really believe you're being treated unfairly -- if you think they have it easier -- then the next time a StG student throws shade at you for being at UTM, just smile and tell them to try a systems course here.	138.51.8.162	-1976366942	0	0	15	1491506856	1

I’m sorry that I’m kind of stressing out; it’s just that I never came to this point before in a CS course.

18003	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1491807996	[quote]My Feedback For This Course \nWhile, I do dislike this course because of how rapidly it changed and how much time was being spent on the more easier stuff but barely on the hard stuff, I have to say that this was also a very enjoyable course and I appreciate all the effort that has been placed into providing us with the contents of the course.\n\nGood Things: \nThere are a lot of good things about this course such as the fact that we learn concepts and ideas that can be seen in our day to day activities. This really makes this course quite interesting. I find that if I can take an idea learned in class and be able to see where it is used outside of class it helps understand what we are learning and it also gives it a purpose. Another great thing about this class is the video. As an ADHD student I find that even if I go to all the classes its hard to keep focus on the content being taught and I can't really rewind back to the important things. With the video this kinda solves the problem. Furthermore, its great to see our assignment being built off one another. Sorta starting at a rough idea and slowly building up to the server copy program. While there was a big jump in difficulty, I think the fact that we can reuse old code and implement new concepts learned, make this very enjoyable and it helps understand course content. One thing that separated A4 from the other assignments was how the instructions were given. Coming from 207 we were in this scrum and git based form. We had user stories and sorta of a path to follow from the start of the assignment to the end. A4 kinda had that feel to it. Where we had different parts to the assignment and these were the instruction or steps we should follow to finish the assignment. It makes it a lot easier to understand and I think you should continue this more!\n\nDislikes: \nI find that this course feel sorta unorganized. Kinda like if there is a snowstorm and class was cancelled, but you were still expected to come to class. In other words, this course feels like it wants to be an online course but, at the same time it also wants to be a course where you come to class. I see that this is how the idea of Khan Academy was where you watch the video before you come to class, so the teacher can spend more time on teaching and examples with less confusion. This leads to my other dislike. While having videos are great, at times it feels that the professor in the video are either really tired, forced to make the video or skip out on explanations. Sometimes in the video, they jump from a very small idea and fill the entire screen up with just code and concepts learned throughout the semester all at once (function pointer videos). I find that if the professor is very passionate and excited when they teach an idea it makes a lot easier to follow along. You and Dan seem very passionate and excited when you teach, and it really helps not dull out what is being taught! Also, I think more examples in the video or in class would be nice. I understand that this course is meant to use C to teach concepts and ideas but, if there are more examples and practice sheets where we code from point A to point B, it would help us understand why we are doing what we do. While PCRS does provide practice, it misses out on a lot such as sockets and signals which I feel that I had to spend time on my own googling and learning. My schedule was sorta getting in the way of office hours so I couldn't really come to them. [/quote]\n\nThanks for sending this.

18294	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1492670140	[quote]I don't get why utm can't enroll everyone who gets in the cs math and stats program into cs. Unless you want to do math or stats or something else. It's creating false hope. I get that there is a lot of people who apply for cs post, but it's because utm enrolls way too many people into the 1st year programs. I'm hoping that the admission team gets a grip on themselves and start to stabalize the numbers.utm already makes around $1.3 billion in revenue every year. Now if you enroll everyone into cs then their fees increase because of deregulated fees and utm will make more revenue. My point is that if someone who has passed their 1st courses and has a decent cgpa should get into the program. It shouldn't be this competitive, in 2012, cs used to be a type 2 program and you could have 2.0 cgpa to get in. LIKE that's crazy simple. So like why are people suffering to get in because they are off by a few points on the cgpa scale. Like who cares 2.!\n 49 is like 2.5. Perhaps that's why utm has a significant high number of tranfer and drop out rates. In most universities if you get in a program you stay in that program unless you want to change. So what make utm or any of the other uoft campus so special. Besides the fact its like number 16 in the world for cs. Grads from other univeristies still get the same jobs as cs grads here. Perhaps admissions should make the criteria to get into 1st year cs harder, rather than make it difficult to get into post. I see people who are enrolled in stats major because they couldn't get into cs. This is the reason why uoft in general has a large tranfer rate to other universities and it also has a significant drop out rate compared to other universities.\n[/quote]\n\nOh, this is an interesting distraction. Thank you.\n\nFirst off: I don't believe it's true that U of T, in general, has a large transfer or drop-out rate compared to other universities. [url=https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/about/2012/B_04_a-c_UG_Student_Retention_Graduation4927.pdf]This data, while dated, is similar to other data I've seen in my administrative role.[/url] While a 30% non-completion rate seems horribly high -- and  it is -- there are many reasons people don't finish, and it turns out that most universities have about the same rate. \n\nSecond, I started writing a post comparing the German, Japanese, American, and Canadian systems and then decided I was just looking for something to do other than remarking. Feel free to drop by for a chat if that interests you. Instead, here's the crux of the issue: U of T, for whatever reason (and I think it's a good one, but we'd need to talk about school in Germany to have that discussion), lets people take any courses they want in first year. \n\nThe advantage is that you have freedom to study what interests you and to change your program of study as you like. The disadvantage is that planning, on the side of admissions and the departments, is far more difficult. For example: last year, the OR admitted about 250 students who said they were interested in CS. However, we also know that they admitted about 400 people who said they were interested in social sciences (that number is made up; I don't actually know how many people are in the social science stream), and a number of them applied to social sciences [i]because they knew it would be easier to get into and that they could still try to get into CS[/i]. There isn't a mechanism in place, at U of T, to force them to stay in the social sciences.  \n\nYou're right that we could enforce such a mechanism, but then we'd just end up picking a small number of people to do CS at year 0, using highly unreliable secondary school marks ... and, eventually, I think we'd shift to a standardized entrance exam. So I don't think that admitting people in year 0 is a good idea.\n\nSo, instead, we could accept everyone who passes year 1. That could potentially lead to huge growth in the program, so we'd need more teachers. \n\nOne option is to hire far more faculty whenever interest in CS (or any other discipline) grows. In theory, that's a great idea, and we [i]are[/i] searching for more faculty in CS. But the problem is, hiring a faculty member is basically ... forever. When you hire them, they'll be here for 30 years, at least, even if the increased interest in the program dries up in 2. So you have to be very certain that the increased demand won't disappear. \n\nThe alternative is to hire temporary faculty, but that is another big discussion ([url=http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/understanding-the-contingent-academic-workforce/40951]here is one very biased perspective[/url]). But regardless of where you stand on contingent faculty and whether a department can run if it's completely formed of part-time faculty, that's not really an option in CS. The problem is that the growth in the discipline is large enough, and pressure from industry to hire undergrads is also high enough, that we don't actually have enough qualified people to hire. Why would someone qualified take a temp job when they can take their pick of permanent jobs? (And that's even assuming we can find someone who wants to do more school to be qualified for a teaching job instead of going straight to an industry job.)	70.53.230.226	1177937634	0	0	15	1492670596	1

In the latter case, we'd be expected to alter how the course fits into the program, either by providing more support in the prereqs or altering the course outcomes.	142.1.1.43	-1912536789	0	0	0	0	1

Is there anything you reccomend I do over the summer?[/quote]\n\nThis should probably be a conversation, instead of anonymous feedback. My answer would vary a lot depending on what you found challenging this term.  \n\nI last taught operating systems three years ago, so things may have changed. The challenge, at that point, was that the programming assignments were far more difficult than anything the students had encountered previously. Part of the difficulty stems from the size and complexity of the code: we used assignments with significant starter code, and the students that term had never been asked to understand a large code base and to insert code into it.  Other difficulty was introduced by the issue of "being the OS": when you're writing a user level program, you can rely on the operating system to provide a layer of safeguards that will keep things from going too wrong. However, as an OS-level program, things can get bad quickly, and you have to be comfortable debugging by looking at values in memory (not printing, because ... printing may be broken).  \n\nSo, my general answer, without knowing you in particular, would be to practice writing code for large projects, and to try to get a bit more practice with C.	142.1.1.43	-1912536789	0	0	0	0	1	
18307	4649	14022	272	RE: Anonymous feedback responses	0	15	peters43	1492783183	[quote]Now that the course is pretty much over, I'll give my opinions and feedback which I think matters because uh, like, shut up okay, it matters. So overall, I feel like this course is pretty good. I'd say really fun but the frustration kinda evened that out to just good. I mean like, the assignments are so cool. Like seriously, I have never had assignments that have built on each other so well, making them all feel like they had a true purpose and not just a lazy way to evaluate student. The end result felt like I had invented the wheel and the fact that we started with a simple array hash to lead into a program copying files over the internet was amazing! But for me, the thing that was frustrating about the course was the way marks themselves were handled. I didn't do too bad marks wise but the way marks were initially given out and then the fact that you had to submit remarks to get the mark you probably should have gotten in the first place, that was kinda fru!\n strating. I'm not saying this to blame you per say, I don't think it's your fault (hell, I think you got caught in the middle of all this with the excessive remarks), I think it's more a result of the way the course is designed as a whole. And of course I realize it isn't feasible (or even smart) to redesign the course or something like that. I can just say that there is room for improvement, like with how evaluations are done. Because for several days I had a lot of unnecessary anxiety over my marks and over worries of failing the course (I almost did an LWD which, looking back now, would have been the stupidest thing ever as my mark is pretty good). I think there are small things you can try, to potentially lessen the panic that enveloped the second half of the course. Like for example, I think maybe remarks could be handled in a better way, perhaps students can come to office hours to discuss remarks in person, or they can schedule a meeting to discuss a remark? I think that would be better for both students worries and for you because you don't have to mundanely read email after email of remarks. I'm not sure, but I'm just pointing out what I consider a problem. Also, I have to say, for any professor that conducts this course in the future (you or whoever), find some way, I don't know what possible way, but some way to drill it into the heads of those 2nd year scrubs that the labs are so good and nice and important, because I realized this waaay too late into the semester. Overall, my thanks to you and Ritu for how you helped us learn, I feel much more like a hackerman after this course. [/quote]\n\nThanks for the note! And thanks for your note about the labs, in particular. I agree they're important, and I'll try to stress them more next year.\n\nI've done interviews to mark assignments previously (in smaller courses, like operating systems) and really liked how it went.  It would be interesting to think about how to scale that to a larger course like 209, and I'll take your advice and think about it for next year.\n\nThe constraining resource with handling marking (or re-marking) is time. If you try to get more time by splitting the work across multiple people, then you have to deal with consistency (and that's an even more challenging problem). The issue is that re-marks (or marking) done electronically is asynchronous; you can send the request when you want to, and we can mark or re-mark when we need to. We don't need to do the work in the office, more or less during business hours.  If we constrained the time that we mark (or re-mark) to business hours in some naive way, we'd still be doing A3 marking, so we'd have to do something clever (or split the work across the TAs in some way that keeps the marking consistent).	142.1.1.43	-1912536789	0	0	15	1492783258	1

However, without evidence of something to try to do that's better, it's not going to change. I'm basing my thoughts on the 209 downtown section, where they've used the inverted (videos before lecture hosted in PCRS, activities in lecture and lab) format for a year longer than at UTM. We’ve seen evidence that the approach is working better than what we did before, which is why we continue to use it: \n\n1. CSC369 used to run an “assignment 0” to get people up to speed on C, and we’ve found we no longer need it. \n2. Performance on a quiz about pointers at the end of 209 has improved relative to performance on the quiz in earlier years.\n\nThe course (and PCRS) can certainly be improved, but based on the evidence we have, the inverted course is an improvement. If you'd like to talk about what would work better for you, I’d love to talk to you in person, if you’re comfortable doing so.	142.1.6.242	-1912535310	0	0	0	0	1

First, ":" is used to introduce commands. Many other commands will require you to start with a ":". Second, "w" stands for "write." It makes sense, like "a" standing for "append" and "i" standing for "insert". (Admittedly, "o" for "open a new line" is a stretch.) Third, "q" stands for "quit".\n\nSo, if you eventually want to quit without saving, it's better to have learned "q" than "ZZ". If you want to save without quitting, it's good that you know about "w".\n\nIf you're really concerned about one keystroke, though, then pick up ":x" (for exit).	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1515556765	1

To do a 492, a student needs to propose a topic area (or specific project, in some cases) to an instructor. The instructor has to agree, and then the two agree on a marking scheme for the course. Then, in theory, the Chair or a designate approves the project idea and marking scheme, but in practice, any project a faculty member is willing to endorse is approved.  \n\nThe trick is to find an instructor who can supervise a project you want to do. Supervising a project takes time, so it has to be something they are interested in and/or it has to be important enough to you that they're willing to take on the additional work. \n\nProf. Rosenbloom typically works with a student or two each term. Prof. Zingaro does, as well. Recently, I've done more 399's (year long courses) than 492's, but that's probably just a function of the projects that I've been involved in.	142.1.4.134	-1912535930	0	0	15	1515604354	1

I don't generally work with volunteers for two reasons.\n\nFirst, I'm generally opposed to students doing uncompensated work. There are circumstances where it's probably worth your time. Being an MCSS exec, for example, is voluntary labour, but the line on a CV is probably worth it. Getting involved in an active open source project, where you can interact with other professionals, is probably also valuable. Doing novel or particularly challenging PCRS development, where I could justify making it an independent study (so you get course credit) also fits. But if you're doing maintenance on PCRS, I feel like you need to be paid.\n\nSecond, volunteers tend to be flaky. If you're doing something for fun -- not as a job -- then it's easy to walk away or to take a couple days to do something else. I think that's to be expected, and I wouldn't blame a student for walking away from a volunteer project ... but getting a new developer is expensive, in terms of time, for me. The first few weeks of work are not, generally, valuable, so for it to be worthwhile to me, I need a commitment.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

Students cannot get outside help while doing the quizzes. And for labs the TA is suppose to help you and you are suppose to get help while learning.

If you earn less than half of the marks on the final assessment, how can you say that you really understand the material?\n\nAt the moment, if you were to earn 50% of the quiz marks in the course and 100% of the lab marks, you would end up with a 35% before the exam and would only need a 30% on the exam to pass the course (assuming that I could resist the urge to bump a student with a 48 or 49 to a 50).  That seems like far too low a score on the exam to pass the course.\n\nBeyond that: While the TAs are doing their best, the labs are not a good environment for invigilating tests. I expect that it would be quite easy to bring in some notes -- or to get some help in the brief bit of chaos as quizzes are collected -- so the problem becomes worse. While they carry weight, we're using quizzes to encourage continuous engagement with the material and to provide feedback when you fall behind.

WaveScalar was a dataflow architecture; you might think of it as a kind of computational fabric or "sea of gates" rather like an FPGA. My job was to compile programs to execute on the architecture, which involved hand-writing a significant amount of dataflow assembly, creating the backend for a C compiler targeting the architecture, and writing optimizations to improve performance for our particular type of system. I worked on that system for about 4 years before moving to U of T and starting up a research program in computing education.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1515820337	1

[/quote]\n\nI hear you, but ... it may be possible, and you're going to have to help me out.\n\nFirst, about helping me out: I need more details to understand what could be improved. Are you referring to all of the errors in general? Or to a specific problem? If the latter, could you be more specific, perhaps by providing the problem name and the error that you're finding difficult? Otherwise, I don't know where to start looking to make a fix ... so there won't be a fix. \n\nSecond, about it not being possible: C doesn't provide great errors.  You'll find, pretty quickly, that if a C program doesn't compile, the line number of the syntax error can be helpful but the message may not be. And if C fails in runtime, you're not going to get an error message that's useful at all. You'll get an abort trap or a segmentation fault, and both of those simply indicate that something got messed up in memory. We can't do much to improve that except to send you to a debugger.	142.1.4.44	-1912536020	0	0	0	0	1

We introduce the memory model at the beginning of CSC209, and you'll see it again at the end of CSC258, when we work with assembly. We'll also spend some time looking at the compiler toolchain in CSC258, and that might help explain why C compiles code the way that it does.  \n\nLater, in the CSC369 (operating systems), you'll see the content from the two courses starting to blend. You'll have to write C code to manage hardware structures, and you might spend some time looking at why some C code runs more quickly/efficiently than others (because of the underlying hardware and OS behaviour).	142.1.4.44	-1912536020	0	0	0	0	1

And also when you get free time what do you usually do?[/quote]\n\nOne of the nice things about this job is that there aren't "usual" working hours. Things change a lot, and I have a great deal of flexibility. The downside of that is that if you like working, you end up working all the time. \n\nSo, just as an example: yesterday, I worked from 6-7:30 on some research; was on campus from 9-5 for office hours, class, and class prep; and then worked 9-1:30 on email and a bit more research. That's a fairly heavy day. I usually take some time off either in the morning or in the evening. However, it's early in the term (which is always busy), and I have a deadline coming up. Research papers for ITiCSE are due on Monday.  \n\nOn weekends, I typically work early mornings and evenings and spend the day with family. I'm going to sound like a really old man now, but: I was a far more interesting person when I was young, and your parents were probably more interesting people before they had you. Now that I have kids, basically all of my free time goes to them. We go hiking and skiing, tend a garden, and play boardgames. When I have some free time, I brew beer and build things/work on the house.	142.1.7.205	-1912535091	0	0	15	1516204220	1

[/quote]\n\nWhile I understand why office hours on Wednesday would be appealing as a venue for last minute pre-quiz questions, it's not feasible. Other faculty have their own work to do, I am not available, and the TAs are busy with labs on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Beyond that, there are other channels -- the discussion board, primarily, but also email if your question is personal --  for asking questions, so it's not necessary, and not reasonable to expect, that there will always be a person ready to meet with you face to face.\n\nSo, how can you get help? I am at UTM on some Wednesdays, and if my door is open, you're very welcome to drop by. (If the door is closed, I either have a deadline or am speaking to someone on skype.) I'm also careful to monitor the discussion board closely when I'm online, so if you post a question there, you'll get a fast answer, either from me or someone else in class. (I read all the posts, so if incorrect information gets posted, I will comment on it.)\n\nIf you have a question that needs to be face to face, you can also send me a note asking for an appointment.

We do not yet know if a strike will occur. The university and the TA union have been negotiating, and the union could strike immediately after reading week, if negotiations do not succeed.\n\n2. In this response (and later ones), I will deliberately not state any opinions on the negotiations or the strike. \n\nWhy the latter? First, I'm a part of the "employer". Second, if there is a strike, it will be very difficult for everyone at the university, and I am sensitive, in particular, to the stress that our undergraduate TAs would face, as they will face pressure both to join a strike (from fellow TAs and society) and to cross the lines (from friends in the program). Please join me in [i]not[/i] placing additional stress on the individuals in our community who are being placed in this complex situation.  \n\nSecond, a response to your question:\n\nYes, CSC209 would be affected. \n\n1.

Marking will be delayed, and I don't know how significant the delay will be. While we are automarking a significant amount of the work in this course, TAs are involved in the creation of tests, so even automarking will be delayed. Midterm and exam marking would obviously be affected if the strike were to occur in the times those assessments occur.  \n\nDuring the last strike, I relayed all non-confidential messaging I received about the strike to all of my students as soon as I received it, and I intend to do the same this year if a strike occurs.

The most obvious issue is, like 209, the lab meetings. However, the impact would be greater than in 209 because we run quizzes in the labs and have work due in each lab.\n\nOf the two issues, the lack of TAs for supporting and evaluating lab work is easier to handle. I'd continue posting the labs each week. Instead of asking you to demonstrate the labs to TAs, I'd ask you submit some part of your schematic (or assembly code) by the end of each week. Fortunately, there will be very few Quartus labs remaining by reading week. We'll be starting to look at assembly code, and that'll be easier to do (and to mark) without TA support.\n\nThe quizzes will be difficult to handle. As a class, we'd have to have a discussion to come to an agreement about how to handle them. One possibility would be for me to invigilate two or three large quiz sessions per week, probably during the evening. The primary drawback there is scheduling: it's unlikely that everyone will be able to make a quiz time, and evening quiz times will be an inconvenience for many people in the class. We could also consider writing the quizzes during lecture, though those rooms are quite cramped; I'm unsure that would work. Another option is to replace the remaining quizzes with a late midterm, though that will reduce preparation for class, which could be detrimental on the exam, or to simply drop the quizzes altogether, though that has the same drawback and also would make the final exam worth a significant amount.  So: there are lots of options, but all of them have drawbacks. Furthermore, quiz grading will be delayed -- almost certainly to the return of TAs -- so you could go into the final exam without much of a sense of what your mark is.  \n\nSo, TLDR: a TA strike would really hurt 258.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

It could have bought down the exam weight to a 40%.[/quote]\n\nIt comes down to a decision about where to employ the TAs, and I had to make some hard choices to get something I wanted.\n\nSome background: In the past couple of years, I've started shifting TAs out of grading roles and into more contact time, in an attempt to deal with increasing enrollment in each lecture section. (Even a couple of years ago, this course had a cap of 90 or 100 students per section, and I can remember teaching it to sections of 30 ... though that was a while ago.) As enrollments increase, I end up being able to do less per student, so extra help has to be available somewhere.\n\nAs a result, I tried to put more people into the lab: In the past, I've put a single TA into each lab of ~30, and the TAs generally got run ragged. They spent all of their time checking work and didn't have time to ask questions about the work or to help debug Quartus issues.  So, this time, with lab enrollments at 40, I tried to put two TAs into every lab section. That doesn't quite work (there is one section that only has one TA assigned), but it's an improvement. Based on the feedback from the TAs I've spoken to, it's been a good change: they still feel stretched, but they feel like they do have some time to help and to answer questions.\n\nPutting a second TA into the lab is expensive: Adding a second TA to each lab cost 2 hours * 7 sections (out of 8) * 11 weeks (154 hours), or roughly three full TA positions. (We get one TA per lab, and each TA gets 54 hours of work per term.) To scrounge those hours up, I had to cut quite a few things: graded assignments, preparation time (by hiring some TAs for multiple positions, we could save their "prep" time in the second contract), and the midterm.\n\nAdding a midterm back would cost 1 hour of invigilation per 40 students (~6 hours) plus, cutting it a bit tight, 10 minutes of marking and mark entry per test (a total of 45 hours) -- or just about a third of the time we spent getting a second TA into each lab. If I cut all of the quiz marking, we'd get about half the required time -- but would need to cut down lab hours by about 20, and then the midterm would be worth 10% plus the value of the quizzes.\n\nJust for interest: Adding one assignment back would take about the same amount of time as a midterm, if we were to mark the whole assignment. We can spot check just a problem or two to reduce costs and get to 4 assignments at a cost of about 100 TA hours.  \n\nSo, it's a juggling act. In this case, I traded the midterm and a few other things for more TAs in the labs. \n\n[b]Edit:[/b] Is this kind of detail about how courses get planned at all interesting to you?	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1517283212	1

I sat on it for a day because I haven't thought about planning this course without constraints since I first taught it.\n\nLeaving specific outcomes related to content aside, here is what I hope you get out of this course. A student should be able to ...\n1. ... provide a high-level explanation of how a modern computer executes code at multiple levels, including at the physical, logical, architectural, and software interface layers;\n2. ... identify and explain several examples where abstraction allows us to simplify the process of reasoning about computers; and\n3. ... discuss how the underlying hardware impacts the code that we write, with particular emphasis on correctness and performance.\n\nThose goals influence both the content (additionally, there is some content I am required to cover) and method of delivery. Those goals, to me, require that you become familiar with multiple computing layers, and the best way to do that, in my opinion, is to actively build something in each layer -- and to make them interact. \n\nSo, if we had infinite time and resources, I'd give you a problem: "When you're done, I want to be able to run this recursive assembly program on a machine of your own creation." And I'd give you some resources: "Here's a board that provides access to a small stack of memory and peripherals and access to a fab to create your processor." "Take your time. Work at your own pace. We'll check in on you."\n\n(In reality, the fab is an immediate problem, so we use an FPGA instead. We can build a tolerable MIPS processor on it. However, time is also a problem: we will not get around to building the control circuitry for our procssor, let alonethe minimal OS that would be required to load programs onto it. As a result, in the current course, you get halfway to a working processor, and then we pause and start from the other side (from the software) and get halfway to generating machine code. There's a gap in the middle.)\n\nWhat structure would support a course like that? We'd need a dedicated lab, so you can come and go as you need, leaving your work ready to pick back up again. Students would move through the course at their own pace, pausing to re-discover solutions (or to ask for suggestions) as they encounter problems. We'd need TA support in that lab constantly, and there would need to be a much lower instructor or TA to student ratio, so that we could monitor how students progress.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1517451418	1

It depends on whether there is a clear, easily identifiable intermediate step that can be marked. However, in many weeks, the TAs are being asked to mark things like, "1 point for a correct truth table" and "1 point for extracting a correct equation from a k-map" -- what does a half mark truth table look like, or a half correct equation? Either the process used is correct, or it's not.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

The course is about programming at the system level, and one of the system resources that has to managed is memory -- so we focus on it. In order to have more direct access to memory (among other things), we chose to use the language C, which, unlike Python or Java, allows the programmer to manipulate memory addresses. (Java and Python provide the programmer with "references" to objects that cannot be mutated.)  \n\nSo: it's the language, but we chose the language because of the course.	138.51.12.145	-1976365935	0	0	0	0	1

However, all of the languages you've listed are ones that I'd consider "C-like." (Well, except for Swift. Swift feels more like a wrapper around C and Objective C.)  They were designed in reaction to limitations of C and in an attempt to implement "objects" in a C-like way.\n\n[url=exploring-data.com/vis/programming-languages-influence-network/]Check out this really cool representation of the relationships between programming languages.[/url] C is a huge node, and if you click around a bit, you'll see that's also a fairly early node. It's influenced by  a relatively small set of languages, some of which are quite low-level and all of which are quit old, and it has influenced many of the languages that we think of as "modern." In some cases, it has influenced languages indirectly. For example, C influenced Java, which then influenced Python. That particular linkage might explain some of the differences that you're seeing and feeling: you're familiar with Python, Java, and C. Can you see what Python gives you, beyond Java? What did it discard? What does Java give you that C does not, and what did it exchange (lose)? \n\nYou'll also see that C influenced C++, C#, and Objective C. C++ and Objective C are particularly close to C, in that they are essentially (with small exclusions, in the case of C++) supersets of C. (C# is more like an updated version of Java, IMO.) What this means is that pure C code will run in Objective C (and, with some changes, in C++). In fact, C++ is transformed into C before compilation, and Objective C's runtime is pure C. They were both designed to try to make an object oriented language that could fulfill many of the roles taken on by C.  \n\nWhat's the difference between C++ and Objective C? It's a matter of philosophy. There are multiple ways to implement objects. Objective C was built around the idea of message-passing between objects at runtime (i.e., Smalltalk), so you could think of it as a runtime library on top of C. In contrast, C++ tries to handle as much of the object dispatch work at compile time.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

Do you think if we should learn verilog after class if we have time?[/quote]\n\n258 downtown is much more digital design focused and has less architecture. That's partly just flavor; the primary instructor downtown is Steve Engels, who is an engineer, and I'm an architect. We see different value in the material, so we stress different pieces.  So, where they spend time in lab creating a capstone design (a large project built in hardware), we spend that time building a mini-processor and then spend more time on the hardware-software interface (syscalls and exceptions).  \n\nAs a result, they need to use a language, rather than schematics, to build their hardware because they're writing more complex structures. (We'll do one lab where we build hardware using a high level design language like Verilog/VHDL, just so you get a taste of it.) We use schematics, instead of a HDL, because they align more closely to the work that we're doing in exercises.	138.51.13.152	-1976365672	0	0	15	1518020219	1

Analyzing a circuit or reading over the textbook for two hours would be much more beneficial than what we do in tutorial. The only time the actual focus of the lab is on course material is during the quiz, after that I'd say less than 10% of time spent in lab is dedicated to actually thinking about course material, with the majority of lab spent mindlessly recreating the circuits we've brought in our pre-lab and being annoyed with the software we have to use.

That will get easier with practice, so in that sense, you may find A3 easier.\n\nA4, if history is any guide, will be significantly more difficult. Part of it is timing. You'll be very busy at the end of the term, when A4 is available. However, networking introduces a whole new set of error modes and makes testing very difficult.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

Removing the penalty gives them the option to schedule work on early-week deadlines without impacting their 209 marks.

Even though we have learned gdb and valgrind, I am finding it extremely challenging to fix memory errors like segmentation fault. Thanks in advance.[/quote]\n\nDebugging C is, in my opinion, all about using gdb effectively to build up a model of what is happening, so you can compare it to your internal model of what should be occurring. When you seg fault, I run a backtrace first, to see where the seg fault is occurring. Then, I look at the code to see if anything obvious jumps out. \n\n1) If the error is occurring on a return or some other line with pointers, there's a very good chance that you had a buffer overrun earlier that destroyed part of your stack.\n\n2) If the line has pointers being used, set breakpoints where those pointers are initialized and updated. If one is not being initialized/updated, then you've found the problem. Otherwise, run the program again, displaying the values of the pointers as you go through to make sure that they (a) match your expectations and (b) don't get modified in unexpected ways.\n\nAs an aside: Debugging is a weakness of PCRS; it doesn't provide good tools, like gdb or valgrind, for investigating what is going wrong. You're best off, I think, in the shell, with full control over the tests you're running and access to the right tools.	142.1.7.175	-1912535121	0	0	0	0	1

I'll cut it apart as I respond.  \n\n[quote]I feel as though the assignments pages are not nearly descriptive enough. They tend to leave more questions about what you as instructors want, rather than how I as a student am meant to do it. I think that when that is the case, something is very wrong.[/quote]\n\nI'm of two minds about this. On one hand, I think you're right that we purposefully leave some questions for you to explore: specific issues with files in /proc, for example. On the other, I don't think that was really the case with this assignment. Here are the things that (I felt) people asked about\n\n1. The structure of cmdline: This one is tricky, because it's a window into memory and can be changed by the process. I can see that we might have added more to handout about it.\n\n2. How to handle error conditions. There are a number of different error conditions, but there's one principle: your code should detect errors and report them. In one specific function, the tree generation function, we specified that when errors are detected they should be reported but the tree should still be built.  \n\n3. How to debug/specific issues encountered. That's not an assignment handout issue.  \n\nSo ... what else was vague?  I feel like there was a lot of traffic on the board, but much of it, in my opinion, was repetitive.  \n\n[quote]For the past two assignments I and many people I've spoken to have felt like we've needed to spend hours reading and re-reading the assignments page, then spend just as much time scouring the discussion board before we are confident that we even understand what it is the assignment wants in particular cases.\n\nI fully understand that part of being a good programmer, and moreover, a good computer scientist, is thinking of the best way to handle cases as they arise in a project. But at the same time, when a lot of these decisions come down to preference and opinion, and not some rules that every student should know is where I have an issue. \n\nTo sum up what I mean in a few sentences, on the discussion board for A2, Professor Petersen mentioned that if generate_ptree returns with a value of 1, print_ptree &quot;should return 2 once an error is detected, instead of printing a flawed tree&quot;. On the other hand, when a friend of mine asked Professor Dema during a lecture the same question, he said that it should print the tree regardless. [/quote]\n\nYour example is a case where "we don't care." In this handout, we didn't specify error output -- we left it to your discretion. We [i]did[/i] specify return codes. So, we expected your program to set a specific status code. We didn't care what it outputted.\n\n[quote]My problem is not so much that these statements conflict, although obviously that's not so good (but the professors are people, these things happen), my problem is that these are both perfectly valid interpretations of the issue, but when it is all set and done, if one student listens to prof Petersen and the other listens to prof Dema, only one would 'be correct' in the eyes of the automated marker.[/quote]\n\nWell, no. The automarker just checked return codes, which is what the handout specified.\n\n[quote]Again, I'm sorry that this is basically just me ranting, but I thought that this feedback would help bring this issue to your attention. I really don't want this to sound like me saying  "you guys need to get your s*** together", but at the same time... well...[/quote]\n\nGiven how much effort was spent supporting this assignment, that's insulting. Your argument would have been stronger if you had left it out.

However, frankly, at the moment, I don't see evidence for what you're arguing. I feel like the difficulties with this assignment were primarily centered on (a) debugging, (b) cmdline, and (c ) learning how to handle erroneous input. The handout contained a lot of info -- I agree with you that it's difficult to read -- but I'm not sure how much more we could have specified. I'd be happy to talk further, though, if you have other things you'd like to say or to point out.	142.1.6.74	-1912535478	0	0	15	1518797816	1

We're looking at the interface between the user and the operating system (systems programming), and C remains the primary language in that domain. C was originally created to replace assembly languages for systems programming, and many operating systems and systems tools are still written in that language. Gnu/Linux is primarily written in C, for example, and the libraries that other languages use, like Python, are often written in C and have a wrapper around them.  (Heck, one of the popular Python implementations is written in C ...)\n\nThat being said, we [i]could[/i] use a higher level language. However, very few languages provide a raw interface to memory like C does, and I think there's value in learning about that interface. It forces you to confront the idea that you're executing code on a machine and that the code you write is manipulating resources on that machine.	142.1.6.74	-1912535478	0	0	0	0	1

The first one you've already listed: when I've posted tests beforehand in the past, people code to them and don't develop defensive coding skills. When you know you don't have to worry about an error occurring, you don't have to think about how to code it the right way. This is the first course (I think?) where you are being asked to check for errors from both the user and the system, and it's important to develop a sense of what needs to be checked and how to do so efficiently.\n\nThe second reason is that I feel it would be a disservice to spoon feed you a spec. Identifying potential trouble spots and figuring out error cases are important skills. By giving you a set of tests, I'm obviating the need for you to develop skill at identifying trouble cases.  \n\nFinally, you haven't actually lost any marks -- that you can see, anyway.  You probably will lose a few for return value issues and the other "little things" that you didn't list, but I can't yet tell you how much. Once you get your marks, let me know if you still feel the mark is unfair.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1518934630	1	
26967	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1518933906	I seem to have started something by posting a warning about academic integrity. I got two similar posts, so I'm going to answer them at the same time.\n\n[quote]In regards to the academic integrity post, I believe there would be a lot of similar code in terms of how starter code was given. First off, using lstat or getopt for main functions would cause a lot of similarity. As well as how the tree is suppose to be printed there would be only a few possible ways because it has to be printed in a certain order. What i am trying to ask is, how are you assessing code, in terms of how it was copied or not copied but looks and does similar actions. A lot of people have been taking about how their code could be similar but they had no direct help from anyone. I would highly recommend you sending out emails to those you think committed an academic integrity offence possibly during reading week because a lot of people seem to be on edge. [/quote]\n\n[quote]There's only so many ways to implement and complete the lab solutions. In some cases even, the variables might be the same. For instance, indexing variables could very easily be the same and the "m" variable in read_pixel_array is the one the instructions tell us to declare and assign.\n\nHow could you possibly distinguish from an academic offense and two labs that just happen to be coincidentally the same? Especially the lab on week 2, you should know more than anybody else that shell scripting is rather precise.\n\nAlso, more often than not, the TA may show how they began the lab themselves, even tell us to use their starter code to get started, or advise a group of students how to solve a problem. All of this means several students could easily have similar code and a similar implementation. So should students not listen to their TA's advice so that we don't get an academic offence?\n\nThe labs are quite a collaborative space whether you agree or not.\n\nIf we get hit with an academic offense notice just by mere coincidence, how could we even argue against that? I could be hit with a notice, not know the other person, and have no defence at all. If this was an assignment, I'd understand that only really the starter code should be the same but hitting people for an academic offense on their lab is when you get into murky waters.\n\nIn almost every case, the student would not have a defence for themselves. This is pretty ridiculous.[/quote]\n\nSo, first off: it's clear you're both feeling threatened. I'm sorry for that, and if you didn't do anything wrong, I'm pretty certain you won't hear from me.\n\nSecond, you're both making the argument that there are only so many ways to write the code. Respectfully: that's not true. \n\nI mean, sure, if I were just looking at one program from the week 4 lab, there won't be a huge amount of variation. However, if I look at all of the code submitted across multiple labs, that's enough code for coincidences to disappear. For example, when I compare all of the lab code for each student in the course with every other student, I'll get [b]~300 ** 2 = 90000[/b] pairs. One tool I used reported that the 200th pair was "8% similar". For the assignment, that number was "6% similar" for the 200th pair.  The number of line matches another tool reported went:\n\n[code]1. 231\n2. 152\n3. 91\n4. 91\n5. 90\n6. 77\n... 20. 54\n... 100. 36[/code]\n\nYou make a staggering number of choices when you code. Do you declare variable A before B? While loop or for loop? Helper function or not? Pointer or array? Coincidence becomes astronomically unlikely with even a moderate amount of code, even when a team is using a shared style guide (and trust me, the style in this class isn't consistent).\n\nIs there still a chance that a pair of twins are on the same wavelength and wrote the same code? Sure. (Aside: I had some actual twins claim that recently. They weren't telling the truth.) That's why I use multiple tools to identify potential similarities, and then I manually review the code to make sure I'm confident that there's enough evidence to at least investigate. Before writing a final report, I meet with the students involved and ask them for possible explanations (a post on stackoverflow, instructions from a TA, ...). Afterwards, unless I am confident that I can convince a non-technical faculty member from the Religious Studies department (or someone equally inexperienced with code) that what they're seeing isn't a coincidence, I recommend that the case be dropped. That lets a bunch of cases through where I'm 90% sure that something has happened, but if I can't prove it, it gets dropped.\n\nAnd that brings me to a third point: prosecuting a single case takes an insane amount of time. (I've spent around 8 hours reviewing code so far this weekend, and we haven't gotten to interviews yet.) That's part of why I hate it so much. The other reason I hate it is because I have to make some people very unhappy, and usually, one of those people thought they were doing their friend a favor. However, if a student is trying to skate their way through class, they're stealing from everyone else, and I can't have that. If someone manages to cheat their way to a good grade, they could get into POSt ... and then someone else next year won't, because we'll have one less space. If they cheat their way to a degree, then they'll get a job, and they'll contribute to the perception of U of T degree holders. Your degree is worth less whenever someone leaves who can't actually do what they need to do.  \n\nSo: please bear with me. If you are falsely accused, just attend your interview, tell me how you got your code, and we'll probably find a good reason for it. (We could also find out that your roommate stole your printouts from a trash can and sold them. True story.) And if you cheated, do me a favor and just admit it; it'll save us both some time.  \n\nThe first post also recommends that messages go out soon. They should. I've sent the list of people I am planning to interview to the department. Once holds are placed, those people will get an email from someone in the department office to set up an appointment time with me after reading week.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1518934190	1

[/quote]\n\nI expect that being in the lab, with classmates around, means that you'll speak to them, and having the TA in the room means that there will often be a single approach that the entire section takes on a given problem. However, you should still be writing and debugging your own code. I shouldn't be seeing, for example, identical comments in multiple submissions.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

27015	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1518982834	First off: thanks for the message below. However, it echoes a number of the issues raised [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=7467&pid=26704#pid26704]in this post[/url], and I feel like my response is limited in the same way. That is: I don't agree with the premise and need more detail. I'll comment on that below.\n\n[quote]I have some serious concerns about the way the assignments and labs are structured in the course. \n\nFirst off, while doing the labs during our allocated lab time, classes are always packed and its often hard to reach for a TA to ask for help which often can take up 5-10 minutes of our time. The TA's seem to be understaffed 80% of the classes and it shows a lot when they're constantly running around trying to solve the many unexplainable mistakes that may happen in C.[/quote]\n\nI hear that. I wish I had more TA hours for labs. I've made some changes to get more TAs into labs, in both 209 and 258, but an open lab structure like 108 would be ideal. It's something Prof. Zingaro and I have spoken about.\n\n[quote]Next, the assignments are always worded very broadly and awkwardly for something that needs very defined and specific answers. We are always told how these tests are run by scripts and that all answers must be precise however the assignment pages, even after re reading many, many times make it very unclear what they want in many of the exceptions. At this point I see many of my classmates spend more time asking clarification questions and losing marks on technicalities that were otherwise undetectable. [/quote]\n\nThis is the part that I find difficult to agree with (and I certainly don't agree with "otherwise indetectable" -- people lost marks on stdout, tree structure, and status codes, and those are definitely not indetectable). \n\nI do agree that there is room left for exploration (on purpose). For example, we didn't provide the format of cmdline; we asked you to figure it out. However, could you give me specific examples of what else you consider to be vague? I tried to list what I saw in A2 in [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=7467&pid=26704#pid26704]this post[/url], and that didn't add up to enough for me to think there was a problem. \n\n[quote]I understand a lot of computer science is about googling and trying to find answers to our mini problems on our own but when the marking scheme relies on specifics its very hard to be confident in your work even after spending days on error checking.\n\nSorry if this comes off very harsh as I do find many aspects of the course interesting and well organized (particularly the language itself and the lecturing), however the points I've touched upon just makes lots of us feel constantly stressed about not having done enough and eventually giving up. \n\nThanks for reading this if you actually got down to the bottom.[/quote]\n\nThanks again for the post!\n\nLike the last post I received on this topic, though, I have to say that, respectfully, I don't see evidence of your perspective. You're asserting that the handout was vague, and I agree that people spent a lot of time asking questions on the board. However, it feels to me that there were a couple central discussion points (from the other post: cmdline in /proc, handling errors, and debugging memory) -- and those were the intended issues in the assignment.  \n\nSo, could you give me examples of things that you found vague, so that I can judge whether that was intentional or something I should be trying to fix?	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

27128	7493	24122	357	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1519012883	I'm appreciative to whoever wrote the post below, since it clearly took a lot of thought and has given me a few things to think about. \n\nUnfortunately, though, OP: I'm going to disappoint you. You've called for changes this term, and while there are some activities I can think about changing up in the second half, you're not going to see wholesale changes this term. First, I firmly believe that preparation followed by active learning in class is superior to passive presentation of facts, and some of the changes you've requested feel like concessions to the reality that students are not preparing, rather than changes that will enhance learning for the students who are engaged in the course. Second, the course itself changes in the second half of the term, as we start talking about architecture rather than digital design, so some of the issues you raise may be reduced simply because of changes in content and structure.\n\n[quote]Just gonna echo some sentiment previously stated. The majority of our labs are spent just dealing with Quartus issues. Yes there is a value in using the tools in the field for familiarity, but the value has evaporated off and has become not only an annoyance, but a legitimate hindrance in our grades.\n\nFor example, in the lab, I finished my four bit circular register, the TA verified that the circuit was correct. Yet I was being penalized for not knowing about a tiny feature about Quartus, rather than on the content of the course and my knowledge of it. Clearly I have demonstrated my knowledge in creating the circuit and the TA agreed several times over, but the waveforms are what almost always gets me and my group. It has nothing to do with getting “better” at using the software either. At this point I think we can agree many of us are quite proficient users of Quartus + Qsim. However, one oddity such as making sure we put a design on the top level, knowing how to name a bus, importing all the blocks for every new project, there’s probably at least 1 seg fault in there somewhere; point being, small issues can and do have a big effect. I dedicate all that time towards a waveform that doesn’t look up to par, and as soon as the 2 hour mark hits, my time’s been wasted, the TA’s time has been wasted helping an unknown error, my peer’s time has been wasted because the TA was helping me out, and of little to no benefit too. Imo, the cost is greater than the learning experience.[/quote]\n\nThis echoes other feedback I've received, and I'll look into other systems before next year. You'll be using Quartus one more time this year.\n\n[quote]Here’s another issue, the readings. The readings just aren’t working.\nI know after reading that line, you’re probably going to want to double down on your current position, but try to keep an open mind reading forward.\n\nYou asked the lecture if anybody had done the reading and nobody raised their hand. If you know your students aren't doing the readings, why do you keep pushing it down our throats? We're halfway through the course and you have heard of the disdain but I haven't seen much more than a mere acknowledgement of our grievances. You said it yourself, you get way more complaints about the 258 book than you do props. Feel free to add me to that list.\nWhat is your primary goal with the readings? Maybe that you intend that we discuss challenging or interesting content in lecture? How are you maintaining the balance of rewarding “the students who spent extra time working through some challenging logic” and students who simply didn’t? The assumption that students understand enough of the content for you to continue in lecture as if we do is lacklustre at best and poor judgement at worst. Making that assumption screws over the students who didn’t do the reading, and it’s just downhill from there. You’ve said you don’t want to rehash the book, but that wasn’t the request, nor would that be wanted. I think that students would be much better served if we’re all on the same page in lecture and afterwards if the student wants to advance their knowledge let them do so. Currently the lectures don’t really do that.\n\nYou’ve put up office hours as a solution to bridge the gaps in information. However, I don't think I should have to go to office hours to discuss fundamental definitions and nor should anybody else. Fundamental definitions that should have been presented or briefly reviewed during lecture, as part of the 258 course.\nI once approached you and asked you a question about the material from the lecture. My question wasn’t answered since I had only done some of the reading as compared to all of it, and that wasn't up to your expectations. Whether I had done the reading is irrelevant, I as a student, had a misunderstanding in the material, and you as an educator should have dispelled that misunderstanding regardless of your personal teaching philosophy.\n\nLet me be clear, I am by no means against the idea of asking or requiring the class to do some prep work before lecture. Peer Instruction, in Dan’s words, “is simply one of the most effective ways to teach computer science” (https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=6270&amp;page=2&amp;highlight=Peer+Instruction). The idea of doing the readings before lecture to get our minds going is certainly a good supplement, but not a good substitute for material should be covered in class.[/quote]\n\nI keep pushing reading because I feel like it's not unreasonable to ask students to prepare. If I tell you, "You have to prepare to really get value out of lecture" and then provide you with a guide that tells you what definitions I'm looking for you to acquire before class (although you may think it is a scavenger hunt, [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~peters43/258/guides/week5.shtml]asking you to find the material[/url] [i]is[/i] fundamentally different and more valuable than telling you to memorize it), then I expect that preparation. If I start providing the results of that prep in class, it'll encourage people to do even less (and I wouldn't blame them). \n\nI think we fundamentally disagree about your responsibilities and mine. I think, though I'm being uncharitable, that you're telling me that it's my job to make sure that everyone learns in class. I believe it's my job to give you the resources and opportunity to learn and your job to take that opportunity.\n\n[quote]An anecdote of my own: Larry didn’t go over latency much when he taught 258, and the last time you taught it was a while back. As a result, none of the TAs I asked knew how to do a proper timing analysis nor could give me a conclusive answer to my questions. I even did the timing analysis reading (and even accidentally read about glitches and hazards too!), wrote about 5 pages of notes on an 8.5 x 11. I sought out help with timing analysis beforehand, and am frustrated with the mark I received, a fat zero. My peers didn’t do much better though. The lab had a quiz average of less than 20%. But how would I know where I went wrong? My TAs don’t even know where I went wrong.[/quote]\n\nWhile I enjoy working with undergraduate TAs, in particular in courses where the lab work is fairly static, you've hit on a major issue: they are not experts in the material, so they are not, in general, well prepared for situations that look like office hours. While you've dismissed the need to attend office hours above, I do think it's necessary in situations like this, where the TAs do not have the expertise.\n\n[quote]I came to class, I did the more than the required readings, I sought out for help and I still lucked out.\n\nI have a prediction: the final exam probably won't be fun for many students. If mastery based learning is the approach you’re going with, it’s definitely not happening with this course. We have no reason to review content nor delve deeply for the week's content, since it won't popup again until several weeks later in the final.[/quote] \n\nHere, you're speaking about motivation, and your post has made me realize that it's something I need to think more about. You seem to be asking for extrinsic motivation because intrinsic motivation -- the desire to learn the material for its own sake or because you enjoy it -- is not sufficient. I was hoping the weekly quizzes, along with the cumulative nature of the material, would provide that motivation, and it has filled that role in past offerings, but you're telling me it's not working this term. That's something I'll consider before next year.  \n\n[quote]One potential solution would be to chain the labs together, so that we’re forced to have knowledge of a previous week. I’m just going to go out on a limb and say, this is a bad idea. Chaining of any kind is a solid way to screw over students, when really the problem lies in the deliverance of material.\n\nIn my opinion, the time you put into “vetting” the reading guides would be much better placed into telling us what exactly we need to know to prepare for the lecture. Such things could be definitions, formulas, basic examples just to get our minds thinking about the material before lecture. The status quo now is that “the reading guides tell you what terms you should know”. Well yes but you want us to go on a scavenger hunt that many don’t want, deciphering through either the 258 textbook or Google to find those details. Again, why should I do that when I am taking a course that is suppose to be teaching me, not me teaching me. On top of that, I’m not really sure what you’re “vetting” anyway; all the material is from your previous offering: https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~peters43/258/guides/ .[/quote]\n\nHere's another big difference in perspectives. From my perspective, the job of the course isn't to [i]teach[/i] you. It's your job to learn, and it's my job to help you find the most effective ways to learn the material and skills I think are important. I do not believe this is a course where memorization is key. If that were the case, I'd give you definition lists. However, it is important that you have the definitions and have seen them in use, so we can extend the ideas to other examples and you can apply them in other situations.\n\n[quote]Should you choose to continue the status quo, please, please at least briefly review the key concepts from the readings in lecture or as you’re doing an example, quickly rehash the definition so we’re all on the same page. \n\nI’m trying to give you alternative solutions to what there is right now rather than just doing a rant about the course. Anonymous feedback is here so that we can all improve the course together. Here’s the problem though, I don’t want a nudge for 2019’s 258 class, I want some change for our class, the one you’re teaching right now. Please take this into consideration for the coming weeks.\n\nps. and if you think this is long, wait till course evals.[/quote]\n\nAbsolutely. Thanks, again, for sharing your thoughts.

[/quote]\n\nI'm hesitant to give you advice without knowing more about your specific situation, but here goes ...\n\nA2 is worth more than just the 10%. The midterm material draws from the lecture worksheets, labs, and assignments -- and the assignments are the culmination of much of that work. In addition, later assignments will rely on you using dynamic memory and handling errors in syscalls and user input in a natural way, so not doing well in A2 could signal that you will have extra work to do to complete those assignments.  \n\nSo I guess my answer is that if you didn't do well on A2 for reasons that can be fixed by the midterm and/or weren't related to the assignment content (too many other deadlines, a misunderstanding of the requirements, failing to commit the final version of your code, etc.), then A2 is just 10%, and you can make it up.  On the other hand, if you are struggling with error handling or dynamic memory, then there's a great deal of work to do before the midterm, and a weak performance on the midterm should trigger you to consider whether you can catch up this term.	50.233.237.162	854191522	0	0	15	1519189078	1

The instructor's job is to investigate; the penalties are set by the Chair or, if the case is referred to the Dean's office, by the Dean or a designate.  \n\nThat being said, penalties tend to follow patterns. Typically, for a first offense that's handled at the department level, you'll see a 0 on the marked item. For a second offense, the case has to be handled at the Dean's office, and the penalty is usually a 0 in the course, suspension, and a transcript annotation.	50.233.237.162	854191522	0	0	0	0	1

Last semester in CSC236, Dan Zingaro gave us his opinion on it stating how he felt it was unfair and has an absurd requirement. It is very interesting to hear Professor's opinion on this.[/quote]\n\nUTM and StG have two different philosophies about the students they want to prioritize. Both approaches have weaknesses, in my opinion. \n\nStG is looking for a demonstration of your abilities in the most applicable courses (CSC148 and CSC165/MAT102); in effect, they're asking if you're going to pass the later CSC courses. The danger with this is that, in my opinion, it dissuades people without backgrounds in CS and math. Because they get plenty of candidates with prior experience, the required marks in those courses are high, and there isn't time, in my opinion, to make up for weaknesses from high school.  \n\nUTM is looking for general strength (CGPA). We're looking for people who are academically solid. The danger with this approach is that someone can actively game the system to artificially raise their CGPA. \n\nThe flaws of both systems have been exacerbated by the very high demand for the program. Raising the CGPA requirement encourages people to game the system -- to take time off of CS to raise their GPAs -- which doesn't help them graduate or improve their performance in later years. It also encourages students to take easier math courses that are, in my opinion, less relevant to the program. On the other hand, StG has raised the course mark requirement about as far as it can go; there is less and less "time to learn" in the key courses.\n\nWould I say it's "unfair?" No, but I just pedantically object to many uses of that word. (We use the phrase "not fair" about events that are demonstrably fair from at least one perspective but that simply don't have the result we want. In this case, we're enforcing well-publicized rules consistently -- we're being "fair" -- but no one likes the process or the result.) The only unfairness I see is that we are applying the same rules to everyone, regardless of how much progress they have made or potential they demonstrate, and designing an admission policy that attempts to fix that would lead to cases where a student with a 2.0 is admitted when one with a 3.0 is not (and that would surely be called "unfair" by someone). \n\nI would say, though, that I don't like the current system, as I don't like the stress it puts on the students and the community. The first and second year courses now are very different than they were a few years ago; students are much more concerned about marks, for example, and the stress of performing to such a high standard has increased pressure on students to cheat and to act in other antisocial ways. I'm also concerned about long-term impacts these policies will have on the community; I expect to see even less diversity than we currently have, for example.\n\n[quote]Dan also stated that if he had to do his undergrad again with these requirements, there was a possibility he would not even make POSt. Do you think you would be able to get into POSt?[/quote]\n\nYes, but as I noted in response to another question about marks: I was an absurdly good student as an undergrad. (I finished with a 4.0.) I wasn't, however, a very good computer scientist or programmer as an undergrad; that didn't happen until later, after I stopped caring so much about marks and focused more on developing skills.\n\nThat is, yes, an argument for trying to keep the GPA requirements low. The higher they go, the more people focus on the stupid things -- trying to get every point and worrying about a half-point lost here or there -- and the less they focus on the things that matter -- asking questions, learning how to read with a purpose, getting an intuition for handling user input errors, getting ahead of memory errors using tools like valgrind, etc.	67.108.126.82	1131183698	0	0	15	1519447896	1

One of the tricky things about "academic integrity" is that it depends on what is expected of the students. Okay behaviour in CSC108  is certainly different from CSC263. That's why it's important to review the description of academic integrity that should be in the course info sheet.  \n\nFor CSC209, our academic integrity block suggests, with emphasis added:\n\n[quote=Infosheet]• [i]Never look at another student’s assignment solution.[/i] Never show another student your assignment solution. This applies to all drafts of a solution and to incomplete and even incorrect solutions.\n• Keep discussions with other students focused on concepts and examples. [i]Never discuss assignments before the due date[/i] with anyone but your instructor and your TAs.\n• Do not look for assignment solutions or partial solutions on the web. If you use the web as a reference and find utility code (general code that is not directly related to the task required by the assignment) that you want to use, please check with your instructor first, and then please [i]cite the source by placing a comment above the copied code[/i] that describes the code being copied and that provides a link to the original source.[/quote]\n\nSo, under those rules, yes, giving someone an idea [i]that helps them solve an assignment[/i] would be considered an academic offense. However, if it's just a high-level discussion, we wouldn't be able to detect it, and I think we all understand that you do discuss approaches and that it's helpful to do so. It only gets problematic when the discussion includes so much detail about code that I can see that you spoke to each other when I look at the artifact that is produced.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

We just end up watching some boring and vague videos. Learning through pcrs is far less helpful than attending lecture in my opinion. I wonder if you think increasing the lecture hours would help for next years?[/quote]\n\nI'm sorry you're not finding it helpful. I do think it's less effective than it is in 108, but I'm still getting more positive feedback about it than negative. I think it would benefit from having more coding exercises early, while we're working on coding, and downtown, they're experimenting with adding short answer questions to evaluate some of the later systems work. I haven't bought into that yet, as last year's experiment with short answer had a negative affect, but I could imagine introducing it next year.\n\nAdding extra lecture hours is a non-starter. Changing the hours (and requirements) for a course is a complex process that, ultimately, requires approval from multiple levels of campus committees, and we don't really have a case for requesting an increase for 209.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

Thanks [/quote]\n\nHere's the normal caveat: it's not up to me. This is a full faculty decision, and we generally operate by consensus.\n\nWith that out of the way: I don't, personally, see a reason to push it that high this year. However, when we discuss these issues, a number of factors play into the decision: stress on the student body, stress on the faculty, the number of instructors available to teach third and fourth year courses, the perceived quality of the education we're able to offer (are we able to provide for the community? work with students individually or in small groups?), and the perceived quality of students leaving the program (are the students in third and fourth year meeting the outcomes we've set as graduation expectations?). We make the decision based on what we think is good for the community -- not what is good for any particular individual student.\n\nWith those issues in mind, from my perspective, we've taken on too much in the past few years in an attempt to reduce the impact on the student body, and the growth has lead to a number of negative consequences. As we grow the faculty complement, develop administrative supports, and encourage the development of a student community, we should be able to counter some of those effects and should be able to gradually increase the size of the CS program. That will eventually reduce the requirements, but it's not going to take a while.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1519795039	1

27618	7493	24122	357	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1519959716	[quote]The quizzes/labs should have been about the previous week's content. The textbook isn't good at explaining the concepts and the lecture is the only thing that somewhat helps me understand the content, and then I get less than a day to study for a quiz that is worth 3%, which I think is nuts. \n\nI have heard you talk about wanting us to learn the best we can, but making us rush through the content in less than 24 hours is not helping at all. I'm very far behind in this course, as are many, many others, and I hardly have time to start from the beginning as I have to spend time on other courses and commitments. My only hope right now is the exam, where I will actually have some time to redeem myself. \n\nI understand that it is too late to make such changes to the course, but this is something that I think is really important to think about for next year.[/quote]\n\nI shifted some material around to try to give you a bit more time to catch up. Next week's material, assembly code, doesn't rely as heavily on the hardware, and that should give you some extra time to review the single-cycle processor material so that you're ready for pipelining (which I had planned to cover next week).  \n\nI could use your help, though. I'm not sure what the cause is (see below), but I'm hearing, from this particular channel, more concerns about grades and more concerns about being behind or unable to do the expected work. Yes, that worries me, and I'm trying to speak to people in person, to try to get a broader sample of input, so if you have the time, please do drop by to chat.  \n\nSo, why am I unsure of the cause? The obvious answer is, "There's too much in this course," but I ran this course with the same content in both 2014 and 2015. Frankly, while there were concerns about the reading and quizzes in the first few weeks each year, it worked a lot better. (I just reread the anonymous feedback for those years, and things settled down by about week 6.) As a previous commenter has pointed out, the reading guides for 2015 are visible in the directory (edit: were available ... I forgot that I just moved things around a bit to accommodate the change for this week), so you can see that we're covering similar material at a similar pace ... and they haven't had nearly the trouble that is being reported this year. The major change between those years and this one is that we ran the quizzes [i]in class[/i] instead of in lab; you were expected to do the exercises entirely before lecture.  \n\nWhy am I hearing more complaints this year? I'm not sure. \n\n1) Anonymous feedback has been more negative than those years, but that could just be sampling bias. It's very hard to know how many people are speaking on anonymous feedback, and I take claims like "a bunch of my friends" with a healthy dose of skepticism. I try to get other evidence by speaking to students in the lab or in office hours, and I'm not hearing as much negativity there (though they're much less likely to tell me, either, so it's difficult).  \n\n2) It could be the quizzes. Since the quizzes are in lab, rather than in lecture, I've felt comfortable putting in larger questions, like those in the exercises.  \n\n3) It could be increased workload in other courses, which is keeping you from being able to spend as much time preparing. I'm seeing students spending very little time working on 209 early, for example, and that's worrying me, too.\n\n4) It could be me and my engagement with this course. My teaching style has evolved, and with the increase in the population, there's also just less "me" to go around. Because I'm dealing with logistics and admin, I'm spending less time working with students 1-1 in office hours and haven't dropped by the labs nearly as often this year as in past years.\n\n5) To be blunt: It could also be you. Student populations do change, and so it's possible that, as a group, you're either putting in less time (unlikely?), have been less well prepared to learn by reading (possible), or simply have different beliefs about what is expected of you.\n\nSo, anyway. I'm thinking about this, and I'd love to hear from you in person. Anonymous feedback is great -- and I appreciate getting feedback from you on this forum -- but it isn't a discussion, and I need a discussion at this point. I need to be able to ask questions of you and to see who you are. (So if you're willing to drop by to talk, thanks in advance!)	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1519959863	1

The latter (in particular, code that uses syscalls like the last few labs and the assignment) are the key elements in the course -- not C syntax.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

It also helps improve the assignments: building an assignment can take a huge amount of time -- and a mistake can be very disruptive on students -- so it helps to have lots of faculty working on each one. (And even then, people will say it's vague. :) )\n\nFor example, Prof. Dema wrote the initial idea for A2, I wrote most of the first draft and the starter code, and downtown did the final handout draft and added diagrams. For A3, they wrote the first draft, and we wrote the solution and are modifying the handout for UTM (since they are using TAs to mark and we need to use scripts, we have to specify more requirements).	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1520092300	1

(Just scanning recent news, here's [url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/1/17066256/google-lawsuit-alleging-bro-culture-harassment]a recent Google lawsuit alleging discrimination[/url], [url=https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320]this memo that a male Google engineer felt comfortable circulating to colleagues (though it led to him being fired)[/url], [url=https://www.fastcompany.com/4036426/at-facebook-women-coders-are-judged-by-a-harsher-standard-report]a finding that code submitted by women at Facebook was rejected more frequently than code written by men[/url], and [url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html]recent concerns about harassment (and lack of funding) for female tech entrepreneurs[/url].) It's also generally hostile to minorities, which in tech is basically anyone who isn't male and either white or asian. I suspect that if you think reflect about your own experiences, you'll remember instances where the environment was hostile. Maybe it was a lewd conversation in the lab? An aggressive or threatening confrontation? It could also have been more subtle -- simply not welcoming. Was someone not included because the group didn't think they fit or were interested in something (a gaming session? a pub night?), or perhaps a guidance counselor suggested that a male student try a math or CS course and a female student try biology? Or maybe we just all bought into the false stereotype of a male, antisocial programmer? \n\nI was privileged to not be aware of any of this until I had been in industry a while (my first two bosses were women) and returned to grad school. In my third year, a woman joined our research group, and my advisor pulled the entire group (except her) aside before a conference. He asked the group of us to watch out for our colleague [i]and to make sure she was never alone with certain faculty that he named[/i]. That was, if I remember correctly, the same conference where one presenter thought it would be fine to include full frontal male nudity on his first presentation slide, where my advisor congratulated us for out-drinking a rival research group, and where I was in an elevator with one of the faculty my advisor named when he made a crude comment about a colleague's underage daughter. What's worse? At the time, that felt pretty normal. We have made some progress.\n\nIt hasn't always been this way. (Elizabeth Patitsas, a recent Toronto grad, [url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2591731]wrote a paper about the decline of participation by women in computing[/url]. It's worth a read.) Women used to be the majority of programmers, and in some parts of the world, they are much better represented than in the western world. However, in the west, the gender gap in computing has been a recognized problem for decades. The problem gained significant attention in [url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/unlocking-clubhouse]the early 2000's with the publication of Margolis and Fisher's [i]Unlocking the Clubhouse[/i][/url] and the creation of [url=https://www.ncwit.org/]NCWIT[/url], an organization devoted to investigating and ameliorating the gender gap in the community. Still, despite their effort over the past decade and a half, all we've done is to find more leaks in the pipeline. We used to think that women didn't choose to start CS; now we know that they are dissuaded at every point in their careers, including after graduation. (Women leave tech at a much higher rate than men.)\n\nIs it going to get better? Honestly, I'm pessimistic in the short term. Elizabeth's research (and others) has uncovered a cyclic pattern where participation by women declines whenever there's a burst of demand in CS. Furthermore, locally, at U of T, we haven't expended much energy to try to ameliorate the problem. ("Why not?" is a perfectly valid question. I don't have a good answer beyond, "I can't imagine taking on more work.") \n\nLonger term, I think things will get better. Industry is aware of the issue and are allocating fairly significant resources to combat the issue. Call me cynical, but they have a workforce problem -- not enough qualified programmers -- and so their interests (finding a larger pool of qualified applicants) align with increasing diversity in this case. Governments are also aware of the issue and allocating resources, and the recent "Me Too" movement and other efforts to empower women will have an impact. But it'll take time, and it'll take a lot of effort to break down stereotypes and to change the industry environment so that we stop valuing overwork (yes, I'm a culprit, too), cease idolizing solitary effort and the "lone genius", and develop work environments that don't reflect "bro culture."\n\nAnyway. That's a pretty massive dump of text, but it's important, and I appreciate the person who sparked it with their question. [i]It's important that you're aware.[/i] Please think about what is going on around you, and if you find yourself in a situation where you're participating, consider what else you might say or do.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

I was really interested in the long post on lack of girls in CS and the posts on your background as a student. I am a more design-oriented student and want to specialize in HCI (human-computer interaction). What would you recommend to students who are more design-oriented but still would like to graduate with a CS degree? Furthermore, for the students are looking to centre their focus in a certain section of computer science, what would you recommend us doing? Will that specialization start to happen in our undergraduate years or will that only come in our masters? [/quote]\n\nThank you! I really like that anonymous feedback lets me respond to issues that people don't feel comfortable asking. \n\nI strongly believe that every person should own their own narrative. By that, I mean that you should have a sense of what you want to happen in your life, and you should be able to tell someone a story about your life that explains how you're getting there. It's never too early to start. To tell that story, you need to able to explain what motivates you about that goal, what experiences you've had that lead you to choose that goal, and what experiences and skills you've obtained that will contribute to you being successful at your goal.  \n\nSo, if you want to specialize in a certain field of CS, reflect on why you want to go there: what about that field appeals to you? Then, consider what things you can do now might lead to later opportunities, and seize them. If you're heading into design, then would art courses benefit you? Design or communication courses from CCIT?  (Should do a CCIT major?) An internship doing design work? (What skills are required for those jobs?) An independent project reworking the UI of, say, PCRS? Plan out your courses and look for opportunities that will contribute to your story. (And if you want to contribute to a PCRS design review and redesign ... by all means talk to me.)\n\nWithin CS, there are a few opportunities to do design work. CSC318 is the entry point for that. (I believe there's a fourth year HCI course, as well.) Many design jobs in tech happen in conjunction with web development, so CSC309 is a good choice as well. Once you get to the fourth year, taking the capstone (CSC490) and taking a design-focused role in your team would be useful. Outside of CS, I'd consider whether a CCIT major is possible and desirable.  \n\nAlso, all that being said, having a goal now doesn't mean the goal can't change. If you realize that you actually want something else, then by all means, change your goal and then think about how your experiences are leading you in that new direction. Rebuild the story, so people can understand what you're aiming to do and what skills and experiences you're bringing to the table.	142.1.3.8	-1912536312	0	0	0	0	1

It's not info you're required to have, but I believe there's value in making explicit connections between courses when they exist. It can be difficult to see how what you're learning might be related to something else you know, and if a connection is made, it might give you a new perspective on both pieces of material. For example, I try to reference Python (108) and compilers (488), too, in an attempt to give you a sense of how things are related. In the case of 209 and 258, we're approaching the same point (the interface between user software, the OS, and hardware) from two different sides, so there are many potential links. \n\nSo, no -- I'm sorry, but that's something I will keep doing.

The teaching-track faculty, like Prof. Zingaro or me, are primarily responsible for doing undergraduate teaching, so we teach 5-6 courses per year. We also have service and professional development (which for us is research) responsibilities.  Tenure-track faculty, like Prof. Fidler or Prof. Bonner, are primarily responsible for doing research and supervising graduate students, so they teach 2 courses per year (plus a grad seminar) and have higher research expectations than the teaching stream.  \n\nSince professorial roles are not temporary, it's expected that we'll be around ... 35 years or so. (As a result, it's very hard to get permission to hire a professor. It's a big commitment.) After three years, a new faculty member undergoes a probationary review, to make sure that everything is going well, and after five or six years, they undergo a promotion review. If they are successfully promoted, they have significant freedom and are basically permanent.  Prof. Zingaro is post-probationary review and pre-promotion review. I am post-promotion review.  \n\nWe just (in January) hired two new teaching-stream faculty who will join us in July, and some of you may have contributed feedback during their interviews in November/December. We are currently searching for new research-stream faculty. You may have seen one of the candidates on campus today.\n\nIf you want a really long, boring (probably) discussion someday, drop by and ask me why there are so many different types of positions.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1520396401	1

I think students should have to learn it themselves because CSC108 was designed to teach how to write code. CSC209 was made to teach more advanced stuff and having to learn C in the course took time away from that. \n\nMoral of the story: In CSC108, we should have learned C or Java, the languages we were going to actually use in future courses.[/quote]\n\nYou're going to end up using a lot of languages in future courses -- and out in the workforce. Python is, in my opinion, a superior starting language than either Java or C, though there are quite a few people who stand by Java as the better option. I don't know anyone, though I'm sure there are a few, who would start with C.  \n\nI agree that the time spent learning C detracts from other topics, but I don't think as much time was lost as you might think from just looking at the syllabus.  Most of C (that you're familiar with) occurred before the second week and was covered in optional PCRS modules.  After that, we dove straight into pointers and dynamic memory -- the new features in C -- and that gave us a chance to look at the programmer's view of memory (the memory model) and how processes utilize memory. Those [i]are[/i] the topics we wanted to cover in this course; it's not so much C (though we did burn some time on syntax) -- it's the model that C lets us see and manipulate. After that, we started doing binary manipulation of files. We did use C, but the point there was the syscalls we were using for the first time (seek, for example). And after that, we got into processes.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

For example, if you're interested in doing mobile development, I'd just jump in and build demo projects in a few platforms, so you can speak confidently about development for mobile devices.

There is a prof at UTM (will not be named and is not CS related) that likes to "challenge" his/ her student by creating questions on test where we have never seen before. I know the meaning of test is to challenge the knowledge of students so that they can expand their learning capabilities but the issue is these questions on these test seem impossible. During our first test this semester, I personally left 3 out 7 questions blank even though I did all my homework and tried to understand it as well as I could. I know other students who are very intelligent and even they are complaining about the difficulty on these tests.\n\nI have personally had this prof for 3 different classes and every time in those classes, our first test have always received a "curve" because of how difficult and low scored they were.\n\nIf you were in our situation during your undergrad, how would you have handled it? I'm assuming there is no way we could "complain" in terms of the profs teaching, can we? I feel like my last resort is to drop the course by March 14 but being a student, I don't want to waste money. Would you mind providing some insights? Thank you![/quote]\n\nThat's tricky. I don't have any magical insight, I'm afraid.  \n\nI think I'd focus on desired outcome. Are you getting what you're looking for out of the class? If so, I'd stick it out. If not -- or if you're not sure -- then I'd seek more info or drop out of the class.  \n\nBy "what you're looking for," I mean: you seem to have known that this prof had a reputation. Did you take this course because you wanted to be challenged? Or does this prof have a reputation that you leave the class with a solid grasp of the material (... with a low mark)?  If so, are you getting what you really want out of the class?  \n\nOr was this prof's testing style a surprise? If so, and if obtaining a good mark is a primary goal, what do students with past experience with this prof saying about the final marks in this course? Do they generally end up okay, after adjustments are made? Or are they low? If they're low and it's not what you signed up for, then you have to consider what the cost of dropping (financial and in terms of wasted time, as you'll need to retake the course) would be.  \n\nAppealing to authority -- to the Chair of the department, most likely -- may or may not have an effect. If the prof is well established, then it's likely that the department knows about this prof's tendencies, and allowing it to continue is either tacit approval or, at the least, an acknowledgment that they can't do much about it.  If the prof is new or a sessional, then it's possible that bringing up a concern about the reliability of the evaluation ("we don't feel we're being assessed in a way that actually measures what we're getting from the course ...") could lead to a review. \n\nIf you'd like to speak in confidence, then drop by my office.

In an other way, I mean to say that if there wasn't a huge demand for CS, would the courses still be the same (difficulty wise)?[/quote]\n\nNo and yes.  As a department, I know we don't intentionally set out to "weed out" students. As a counterpoint: we've maintained a no-entry requirement minor, despite the growth, because we feel it's the right thing to do to give everyone who is qualified (passes the courses) exposure to the discipline. If our primary goal was to reduce the number of students in our courses, shutting down the minor would do it.  \n\nAs an individual prof, I can assure you that intentionally setting out to "weed out" students would not be worth the headache. I am much happier when my courses are running well and everyone feels like they're making progress and earning marks that reflect their effort. When the students are frustrated or feel like they're being evaluated unfairly, it takes a tremendous amount of emotional energy and time to try to address the problem and to support individual students -- and that's just if the issues are a side effect of running the course as you feel it needs to be run. Intentionally setting out to fail people would be even more brutal. I didn't enter this vocation because I wanted to crush dreams.\n\nThat being said ... courses do get more difficult over time, at least in our field, so it's easy to develop a perception that we're making things harder "because of demand." I remember receiving a bunch of early calendars -- the academic requirements for UTM from the 1980's -- and the courses listed were, of course, much less involved than they are today. Partly, it's because we didn't have the ability to run the practical courses we do now; no one had a machine, so courses with a practical component involved timesharing a device or using the one lab in the department.  Partly, it's because the field has advanced; we just know more, and more is expected of graduates entering later schooling or the workforce. While the changes have not been dramatic, I've seen a growth in some courses while I've been at UTM (over the past twelve years). In particular, we've struggled to try to keep modern techs in our courses (Prof. Rosenbloom always leads the effort there), and we've had to find space for topics, like concurrency and scaling, that have become increasingly important.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] I'm backlogged on anonymous feedback again.

I don't just want to test your ability to write code -- although that's a component of the mark, and I could imagine doing part of the test in a lab.

Getting exposed to functional or declarative ideas can help you become a better programmer (since many languages include features inspired by multiple paradigms). It's also a necessary (in my opinion) step to prepare for learning about compilers; you need to know that there are multiple programming models and have a sense of the trade-offs you make when you adopt one before you can start implementing a model. So ... it's probably less practically relevant than it appears when you look at the title.\n\nI can't answer your question about CSC347 and CSC427. You might drop by Prof. Rosenbloom's office to see if has a sense of what employers are looking for, since he teaches the security courses and has built them in response to feedback from alumni in the industry. However, I do have an anecdote about a former student: he went into security at a telecom during PEY and ended up getting hired as a senior security analyst straight out of school [i]because of a dearth of qualified candidates[/i]. This was about a decade ago, so the situation has surely improved, but it's still an area where expertise is scarce.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1520829541	1	
28173	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1520801830	[quote]Just a thought... If CS courses become too focused on practical applications, skills and employ-ability, doesn't that defeat the purpose of academia? like if someone wants to practical training, why come to Uni? Just go to college. Universities were made to expand a person's perspective on an intellectual subject, not train them for some sort of (no offence) dead-end skilled labor job (like software development), - no offence just trying to make a point - ... Barely anyone in CS I talk to is really interested in CS research and studies after their undergrad (as if most people are just looking for ROPs to look good on their resume). Would it help if courses introduced CS research earlier on in the degree and made it available to everybody as opposed to a selected few students who spend their time sucking up to profs (again, no offence, just trying to make a point...). Why not make research the center of more CS courses?[/quote]\n\nI feel like you're trying to bait me into a long post. :) It's a great question, and if you want to talk about it, I'd be happy to have a long chat during the exam period. This week and next are just too busy for a long post (exams are due, A3 tests and A4 need to be written or reviewed, hiring continues, etc.)  \n\nBriefly, though: there's little agreement as to what a university education [i]should be[/i], and our current views on the role of a university are fairly recent. [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna]While western-style universities have existed for about a thousand years[/url] (excluding earlier institutions like this [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Al_Quaraouiyine]degree-granting madrasa[/url]), the idea of a [i]research university[/i] (where faculty conduct research throughout their career, rather than focusing on aligning religious ideas to new discoveries or conveying knowledge to the children of the elite) is only about 200 years old. [i]Mass education[/i] (as opposed to education of a privileged group) as a university mission is also very recent -- dating back perhaps only to the late 1800's. In the US, it was institutionalized after WWII with the GI bill, as an attempt to reintegrate large numbers of returning veterans into civilian life.\n\nSo: the role of the university is in flux. While universities, as an idea, are fairly old, the role they have filled has changed over time. While I'm not an expert in this area, I feel there are three rough divisions that characterize what people expect a university education should do:\n\n1) [i]Job training / credentialing[/i]: This perspective is generally rejected by academics, who don't want to think too much about immediate applicability, but most people would agree with the statement, "Getting a university degree makes you qualified for a better job." Furthermore, this attitude is currently popular with Ontario gov't. The gov't has recently required that all university students undergo an "experiential" learning experience during their degree, and "experiential" is defined as having characteristics of a workplace. \n\n(Okay. I said this wouldn't be long. But professors gotta profess.)\n\n2)  [i]Educating the citizenry[/i]: This was the original stated purpose of universities. There was a feeling that providing a general, higher level of education for the elite (those who would rule ...) would improve the quality of governance, and hence, the strength of a region and its people. (Hence, the liberal arts curriculum.) As the west shifted toward democratic forms of government, the definition of "elite" changed; it became important for everyone to have some level of education, and that has lead to movements to educate the entire population. (Aside: As a negative side-effect, in many parts of the world, compulsory schooling was an anti-immigration / pro- or anti-religious / anti-indigenous reaction that sought to homogenize the population. "Educate the citizenry" became "make everyone think 'the right' ('my') way.")\n\n3) [i]Preparation for advanced study[/i]: This is a relatively modern view that came to prominence with the growth of research universities. The idea is that people undertaking a degree are preparing for continuing, independent study -- or the creation of new knowledge.\n\nAgain -- I'm not an expert on the history of universities. You should do some studying on your own if this interests you, and you'll quickly reach the level of my expertise. But assuming you believe what I've said so far, then ... well, not even your profs really agree about how we should be teaching you. Some profs focus on broadening horizons (educating citizens) or creating future leaders. Others are very industry-focused. Others just want to do research with a few students. \n\nRegardless, introducing more research early in the university degree probably won't have the desired effect of broadening interest. It's not, as you said, of interest to many of your peers who support positions (1) or (2) or to the people (well, all of us, through the gov't) who fund their studies, and forcing it would inevitably require that we shrink the size of the university significantly (and that would limit the research performed unless per capita funding increased significantly). Instead, we've chosen, in some ways, to have a university within the university. A small set of students are here for reason (3), and we do our best to provide opportunities for them. As academics, we (your profs) try to make everyone [i]aware[/i] of research and try to get everyone conducting pre-research activities throughout the program, but that's just not a uniformly desired outcome.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1520829567	1

You've been preparing since you arrived here. \n\nDon't forget the basic interview advice. Do some basic research before you get into the interview. (Know the company you're applying to. Know the position.) Dress to match the top end of the company's dress code. Have a couple of questions prepared, for when they ask you if you have questions, that get you info you need (it's a two-way interview, after all) and also demonstrate interest in the position. Make eye contact, and keep your posture open.  \n\nRemember that you're in an interview situation the instant you initiate contact with the company, and any little thing can count. When you send your cover letter, for example, proofread. (One of my now-colleagues told me that she cut down the applicant list for the job I'm in now by throwing out every application with a cover letter that wasn't, in her opinion, well written -- 80% of the applicants never got their second page looked at. Fair? Maybe not, but it's what she did.) On your way to and at the interview site, act professionally. (One place I worked polled the clerical staff and rejected any candidate who had given them trouble or treated them without respect. I also had a ... friend ... who was told he shouldn't bother interviewing because of the way he had treated another candidate in the waiting room.)

I've heard that CS courses at Ryerson are a bit easier but does that mean the content doesn't compare to the courses here? [/quote]\n\nThank you!\n\nI haven't looked at Ryerson, though a [url=https://www.ryerson.ca/calendar/2018-2019/programs/science/computer_sci/]quick glance at their program[/url] suggests that they split up their courses a bit differently. (For example, C and intro systems are in different courses.) They require 31 CSC-related courses (about 15.5 credits, to try to make it comparable) -- roughly comparable to our specialist. [url=http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~dwoit/courses/cps590/CPS590TestFromW17.jpg]You can also look at a few of the tests in their courses, to get a sense of difficulty.[/url] \n\nOverall -- and again, without looking at it in detail -- it looks like their CS (and Waterloo's) are fairly similar in structure to ours. Our program has more required theory and math. I can't really judge difficulty; that depends on the expectations of the instructors and probably varies from course to course.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1	
28351	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1521028646	[quote]This is not related to the course but more something I'd like your opinion on. Aside from the POSt system one of the things I find most frustrating about this university is that we need to pay for things that I feel should not be monetized, the first example of this that comes to mind is Exam Reproduction Request, as well as the Exam Re-Read Request (up until this year). \n\nWhen I ask other people I know that go to other universities or colleges they have never had to pay to see their exam or have it remarked (they think I'm yanking their leg or something when I tell them that we need to pay $15 for each) Do you think it's fair or normal to have students pay for these fees on top of the already high school fees (relative to other Ontario universities)?[/quote]\n\nI don't have much to say about "fair" (currently, it's charged to everyone who wants an exam, versus charging everyone at the university a portion of their fees, which would go up if reproduction fees disappeared), but I agree that it's not normal. I haven't had a similar system anywhere that I've studied. \n\nHowever, anywhere that I've studied, the profs also ran the exams (there were no invigilators), exams were scheduled roughly during class time, and they were only worth 20-30% of the grade. There just isn't the same emphasis put on exams in many places, and there isn't the same infrastructure in place to set, hold, and then store exams. (And by "store" I mean "place in a room that is secured like a bank vault.") I suspect that's why there is a fee: first, they're charging you the cost of someone's time to find the exam and reproduce it, and second, they're discouraging "curiosity" requests for exam reviews / remarks because the burden of serving those requests would fall on a small number of people in the Office of the Registrar who wouldn't be able to handle getting an exam copy to every student.  \n\nOnce the costs of locating (finding the right exam among thousands is non-trivial) and reproducing exams goes down (when exams are scanned for marking), I expect reproduction requests will go away.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1521028781	1

There's a LOT from March 12, and I'm just going to answer a few that don't need much time to answer. The rest will have to wait.)\n\n[quote]I noticed that this year you guys are accepting 165 people into the program and last year it was 157 students. When looking at responses about how your teaching this course (even 258), you said in an earlier post about changes: \n\n"I'd also like to run "open labs" like we did in CSC108 this year. It would be great if there were TAs on duty 10-6 each day, instead of just on Tuesdays. Like the previous change, that's important to me because you're being expected to "do" things, and it would great if we could provide more on-demand help while you're working."\n\nWouldn't this be easier if you made the courses smaller. There are currently 249 people enrolled in CSC209 as the time of this was written. So there is about 100 people that are not in the program. Isn't there a way to decrease the class sizes, having a minimum mark in a prerequisite to enroll or something to bring the number of students down so that class sizes in second, third and fourth year courses are close to the number of people in POSt.[/quote]\n\nReducing the number of students probably wouldn't help with the vision you've quoted. If the courses were smaller, then there would be more time from the instructor (per student), but we wouldn't actually see an increase in TA hours per student. TAs are assigned to a course based on the enrollment, so you wouldn't actually see much of a change in the number of TA hours per student. The reduction in TAs assigned would make it more difficult to have "open labs" because there won't be enough total TA hours to cover times outside of assigned tutorial hours.\n\nA smaller course [i]would[/i] be easier to run, from an instructor's perspective, though. I'd have a much greater chance of actually spending time, in office hours or lab, with each of you, as I would be spending far less time on logistical work (accommodations, remarking, second midterms, lost work, etc.) that the instructor (or some other central admin staff) needs to handle. Some of that time could be funneled back into extra office hours or time in the lab.\n\nHowever, you do raise a good point that the second year courses are larger than the number of students accepted in the POSt. That difference is made up of students in the CSC minor. The minor is quite large, and while not everyone in the minor takes CSC209 (they have a choice), quite a few do. \n\nThere has been talk among the faculty that the minor should be restricted, as many people take it hoping to transfer into the major later. We took a step in that direction by placing a prerequisite on CSC207 (a required mark in CSC148). However, at the moment, the consensus is that we have a duty, as long as we're able to make it work without impacting the students in the major and specialist programs, to offer a CSC program to as many people as possible, so we don't want to take the step of restricting admissions in the minor like StG has.  \n\n[quote]Does having people not in POSt make the course more challenging so you guys weed out the people not in POSt? I feel that's why the courses seem harder every year. When I see past midterms they seem easier to the ones we write and it will be even harder for people next year when they write their CSC209 midterm.[/quote]\n\nNo, it doesn't. I hear the term "weed out" a lot, and people seem to think that my job is to remove them (or other people) from the program. This comes up a lot in first year. [url=https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~mybb/utmcs/showthread.php?tid=7467&pid=27995#pid27995]It's not my job, and it's not my goal. (Fortunately. Explicitly setting out to remove people from the program would be emotionally difficult work.)[/url] I do, however, have to evaluate whether the students can demonstrate a certain proficiency level.\n\n[quote]Do you think next year's CSC209 or other CS courses will be even larger than it is, and what will you guys do to fix that problem? [/quote]\n\nThey will be as large, I think, but I don't expect a noticeable increase. We didn't see as large an increase in enrollment in first year this year as we did last year, and adding a requirement to CSC207 will reduce pressure in that course (and, as a result, in CSC209).	142.1.4.35	-1912536029	0	0	15	1521035791	1

The world wide web was also fairly new (about 4 years old ...), so search engines weren't very advanced at the time, and course webpages weren't commonplace outside of CS. Some CS courses didn't have them.  \n\nSo, compared to today, while there was help available, it was much less immediate and comprehensive. We had office hours and lab. Some instructors provided their email addresses for urgent queries, but most didn't. Answers weren't available on the web, generally, because (a) if they were online, they were hard to find and (b) people didn't really go to the effort of posting them. As a result, you couldn't expect immediate answers to questions. \n\nBecause there were less examples available, programming assignments tended to be less detailed, and they were always marked by hand. They covered very similar topics, though.  (In the equivalent to CSC209, for example, I remember having to build a bash shell clone over two assignments to explore pipes, fork, and exec, and then we had to build a chat server for sockets and select. It's pretty similar to what we do today.)  In calc, we used Apostol's calculus textbook (and did problems from the textbook) ... and that text is still in use today at my old uni.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

Will we be going into detail about that in this course or is there another course that actually describes what the OS is doing when it receives syscalls on the hardware level, or what assembley/machine code is actually executed when the syscalls are made? Also, the same case with the assembler? Do we ever look at code behind the assembler or learn how to build one(I assume this is pretty hefty as you would need to process text writing in machine code)? Thanks in advance![/quote]\n\nYou'll be dealing with the exception handler in the last lab, and that's the mechanism that allows us to invoke system calls. If you'd like to talk about it in class, please raise the question in class Monday/Tuesday. We'll be spending a few minutes at the beginning of class looking at the func/nofunc examples, and that's a good time to also talk about syscalls. After that, we move back into hardware to discuss pipelining (and parallelism).\n\nThat being said: CSC369, operating systems, is probably the course you're looking for. We look at exception calls as a mechanism, because we are looking at the interface between hardware and software. The OS course assumes that you know about exceptions and then examines how the operating system actually receives info about a requested system call and then handles it.  \n\nBuilding an assembler is a pretty straightforward translation process. (Every assembly instruction can be translated to a machine instruction mechanically.) The trick is in creating a [i]symbol table[/i] that allows the linker, later, to resolve symbols and update the appropriate instructions.

28678	7493	24122	357	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1521409602	Thank you, author below, for chiming in. I'm not going to answer in detail (except to note that quizzing on the past week's content simply isn't going to happen as it removes the incentive to prepare at all), because I think you're reinforcing points that have been raised and responded to before. However, I truly appreciate the in-depth post and have saved it (and a few other posts) to read when I start prepping the course again.\n\n[quote]I have been reading all the feedback that you have gotten. This post might sound similar but I just want to share my experience with this course.\n\nFirstly, the readings and exercises. Some of the readings are helpful and they do help us understand the concepts a bit better but in most parts, it seems to miss the "practical" part. It is great at describing the theory of the device but does not assist us when trying to understand how it all fits together as a machine. It also doesn't help when completing the exercises as I always felt that there weren't enough examples to go with the text. I'd love to see more examples in the future as I think it will be great for the quizzes.\n\nThat leads into the quizzes. I felt that the quizzes were fair but as I just said, there were some times where I stare at the question on the screen and have no idea on how to answer it. Either it wasn't in the exercises or appeared only once in both the readings and the lecture. Furthermore, I personally would like to see a midterm for this course because it is a way for us to gather all the knowledge we learnt in the first (5-7) weeks and truly try to make sense of everything. The quizzes are a great way to see if we are understanding the content, but they shouldn't be the major aspect of our term marks. You could make the quizzes maybe around 10-15% which runs every week, but as a student, you are less stressed about it being the deciding factor of your final mark. I felt that if you do poorly in 'x' number of quizzes, especially early on, you can definitely expect to see a mark below a 70 or a 65 when you write the exam. Also, with regarding the marking of the quizzes, I understand that they are only out of 3, but I felt that the TAs were marking extremely hard in some scenarios. There were times where I was missing a single word or phrase and got 0 on that question. So a better and more consistent marking scheme would be great.\n\nThe labs is another aspect where this course can improve on. I won't talk about the Quartus issues as this was talked about previously. The marking for the labs also had me concerned. There were times where I followed the lab handout and showed the TA everything that he needed to mark, but I still received a mark of 2/3. I don't know why they are marking very inconsistently, but this is where it can be improved. Furthermore, there were times where my circuit worked perfectly and the tests were all correct but because I didn't "demonstrate my understanding" to the TA, I didn't get full marks. I understand that this is important but that is the point of the quizzes. The labs are ways to show us how these concepts all work on a machine and we shouldn't be needing to give a 10-minute 'speech' on why this circuit works. I think more time was wasted in trying to inform the TA about the device rather than fixing Quartus issues.\n\nThe lectures are probably the best part of this course. The way you explain the topics is phenomenal. I really appreciate how you take the stuff we read about and try to tell us more about it and how it actually works in 'plain English' rather than using sophisticated words in the textbook. The samples are also great. More quiz like examples would be nice, but I think that was mentioned in a previous post.\n\nThe thing about this course is that if you do not understand a key idea that week, due to the course moves so quickly, that will lead you to fail a quiz, hardly understand the lab and it will influence your understanding on the next week as the content builds on the previous week. This might be the reason why students perform poorly on the assessments because they are trying to understand the previous week's content rather than trying to understand the current week. One way to fix this is providing us with more tools such as PCRS or having more examples in the textbook (as I mentioned above). The PCRS is usually something I look for in more practical style CS course. In 209, I learnt a lot more from watching the videos and completing the questions rather than understanding the lectures. Also, I think it was mentioned previously, that the quizzes should be based on the previous week's content. This will give us time to understand the content rather than trying to complete the readings, exercises, lecture and pre-lab a day after the lecture. (You can't properly do the exercises without going to lecture). This is why I said the idea of the midterm will allow us to understand the content rather than trying to memorize the information a day or two before the quiz/lab. As a student, I don't like having a 15% or 20% midterm but at least it will allow us to take time to properly understand the material.\n\nI hope these suggestions are ideal and if you can't implement them this semester, I hope you can have a look at them for next year.[/quote]	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

For this A3, I've heard 50 different things from 50 different people (exaggerating). Even the TAs are giving conflicting information where the advice from one TA contradicts something said by another. This whole assignment is a complete mess and it has already taken a very large amount of my time with no success. The assignment description is too vague whereas the tests are so precise that our functions are switched for others. In my opinion this is really unfair. Another thing is, the resubmission is an extremely bittersweet thing. We have A4 to work on as well as multiple assignments from other classes in the < 2 weeks which are remaining. You could have been a bit easier on us especially at this time of the semester. \n\n-Student who was doing well until this mess of an assignment[/quote]\n\nI have some trouble with the statement that it's vague. If anything, I felt like this assignment was over-specified. I don't contend that it was easy to understand the intended structure -- building a pipeline is non-trivial, and really getting processes and the implications of the process-pipe interaction is challenging-- but we essentially only permitted one viable design.\n\nYou're right, though, that things are going to be tight the next couple of weeks. Your profs generally get quite busy a couple weeks before you do (prepping the work you're doing), and this week has been a doozy.

29538	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1522247583	[quote]Hi, Professor!\n\nAs someone who just finished A3, if you wouldn't mind, I'd just like to share some quick thoughts on it.\n\nFirstly, the basic idea of it was quite simple, but actually getting to implementing everything with pipes, processes, pipes within different processes, I got quite stuck at planning everything out, and was scared I wouldn't be able to do it at all. In the end, after the initial (continuous) cursing and checking on (living in) the discussion board, it was undeniably a fun assignment. It always seems so easy after doing it. Hope you don;t get much fire on this one.\n\nWhat I'd like to stress on is the assignment handout. While a lot of it didn't make the most sense until having implemented it (which is normal), a lot of the wording threw me off. The whole purpose of make_stage was a problematic area for most, and it didn't help when the wording was confusing. For example, the handout said the child process "returns the value 0, to signal that it should handle the next stage"; it's essentially saying (A returns 0 to signal that it should do X). "It" (technically) refers to A (since it was the subject) instead of what called A. Knowing that returning is usually the end of a function, then it's obviously not that same process, but it still could've been anything else since "it" was used ambiguously.\n\nIt's a small thing, yes, but could you believe it got me stuck for a while?[/quote]\n\nThanks! I'm glad you had fun with it. \n\nYou're right that pronouns can cause problems if it is not clear what the pronoun's antecedent is. I don't know that I agree that this particular pronoun is ambiguous, though. "IT should handle the next stage" must refer to code running within a process (not the "return value," which is the subject of the sentence).	142.1.2.212	-1912536364	0	0	15	1522248162	1

29541	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1522249598	This is a cool set of questions.\n\n[quote]\nHi, Andrew\nI have a couple questions regarding the study space in DH.\n\nI was wondering what the situation is about study space for CS students, are we getting more lab/study space for MCS with the building of the new North building?\n\nI've noticed there are many unused offices on the 3rd and 4th floors, is it possible to open up such offices as work spaces for group work? \n\nWhy is the air condition/ventilation cut off during the weekend in the CS labs, even when there are students working? \nA follow up is why the math and stats room are locked during these times as well. \n\nThere are often many lab computers with significant issues, such as flickering or not working. I understand Andrew Wang is working through it, but is there something as students we can do to not mess them up as much? besides forkbomb XD. \n \nThe lack of lab space for working on projects and assignments is quite limited, and often students are heavily packed into rooms trying to get work done. The lack of space to work together is becoming apparent with not just CS labs such as 2020,2010 and 2026 but overall in the entire building with Stats and Math rooms, Quiet study, 3050 , downstairs by the cafe, Conference rooms on the 3rd floor, and even the couches outside and around the labs.  \n\nWith the increased interest in MCS and overall enrolment increasing I understand you're taking steps with CSC108 and CSC148 conducting open labs to alleviate the space constraints, but with all due respect as 2nd years we still take quite a lot of space up along with the 3rd,4th years combined we just don't have the space to work on assignment heavy days. The department has taken steps in order to not make this university like UTSG, and be able to take more students in, by hiring faculty. However the infrastructure in place is extremely limited to handle the new influx of MCS growing and the possible amount of students incoming to UTM MCS. \n\nThe building during the weekend still has students here in the labs working on assignments, the labs are sweltering hot forcing us to improvise ways to cool ourselves down on weekends. As a human being i believe no one would want to work in a room where simply walking into the room makes you sweat. \n\nFurthermore the booking of labs such as 2026 and 2020 by other departments not requiring Linux computers to run their events/studys, for example the SKIP lab bookings on Thursday from 1-3 in 2026 for a study takes out more people than they take into the lab leaving the room mostly empty , while MCS students working on assignments are forced out mid-way through working on assignments. [/quote]\n\nI pulled in Andrew Wang, our sys admin, to respond since most of these issues are ones that he deals with. I've edited his response slightly:\n\n[quote=Andrew Wang]Sure no problem ... a lot there \n\n1) I haven't seen the plans for the new building.  I imagine there will be more student space though, as the University is pretty committed to it since ... its a long time big request from students.\n\n2) I seriously doubt the University will open up the spare offices.  [.....] tried to get those for MCS instructors and was turned down.\n\n2) Yeah I think the University turns off (or down) the climate control on weekends to save money.  [...]\n\n3) I am assuming the student is talking about the Math TA rooms.  I wasn't aware they were locked on weekends.  I will make sure (or make the request) to have them open.  I was under the impression that they were open 6am till 11pm 7 days.\n\n4) State of the labs.  My big pain point now is failed and failing drives.  [... The physical computers are managed by another group ...] I also think we got a bad batch as we have 10 - 12 failed drives out of 60 PC's.  I currently have 6 tickets open for failed drives and 1 for a PC that can't get an IP [ ... ]  But as to software issues, I'm on those pretty quick ... at least I think I am .\n\n5) As for booking the Linux labs ... after CS gets their courses scheduled into the labs, its open season on booking the labs.  "those aren't your labs" is what I have been told when I've inquired about making changes to the labs.  I don't think we can exclusively claim the labs ... even linux ones as we don't pay for  them.\n\nI agree with all the comments.  [...] I've asked to get upgrades to the MCS labs (memory) and the labs are on a 5 year lease.  I want to bring that down to 3 years as I really think the labs are going to be in rough shape approaching 5 years.  [...]\n\nFeel free to pick and choose what to incorporate.\n\nCheers,\nAndrew[[/quote]\n\nOkay, my turn.\n\nFirst,, I hope by reading Andrew's post, you see the kinds of things that he works on. He's a personable guy. If you encounter a problem with the labs, please let him know. He'll do his best to fix it or will let someone know who can. But he has to know something is wrong to fix it, so please be vocal when you run into a problem.\n\nIn particular, he's sent a note to ask about opening up the TA rooms, and I've sent a note to facilities asking about climate control on the weekends.\n\nSecond, you have to know that in any organization, there will be some scarce resource(s), and groups in the organization will bicker over how to share them. In some organizations, the scarce resource is money. In some cases, it's people. At universities, the most scarce resource is, in my experience, [i]space[/i]. The problem with space is that universities are generally full, it takes a few years to construct a building, and we only get permission for a new building when (a) there's a demonstrated need already and (b) there is money.  \n\nSo, about existing space: The unused offices on the third floor of Deerfield are currently being held by the Dean's Office, and they are allocating them to staff and new faculty as they arrive. I'm hoping, once the new building opens, that we'll get a few of those offices for our new faculty, since there will be space to move the people currently in those offices to locations near their home departments. However, they won't go to students. Someone else will put in a higher priority claim.  \n\nWhat about new space? The new building has classrooms and many study spaces. I think that will help a lot. There are some new "active learning classrooms" with round tables and whiteboards that I think you'll like a lot, and the plan, I believe, is to have them open for student use when there aren't classes in them. \n\nHowever, MCS doesn't have space in that new building. It's primarily being built for humanities and social sciences units. We do have some plans for lab space for research, but that's a couple years out (in a new new building).\n\nThird, regarding bookings: Prof. Zingaro and I have an evil plan. Since we can't reserve the labs without classes and since we're shifting to "open labs", we're starting to schedule labs in every available slot, instead of running multiple labs in parallel. That should cut down on people using the labs for other things ...	142.1.2.212	-1912536364	0	0	0	0	1

Yes, I try to find solutions that minimize impact on students (hence, the waiver process ...), but I have to make those solutions work within the parameters that have been set.	142.1.2.212	-1912536364	0	0	15	1522254742	1

29565	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1522260320	[quote]Now that course evaluations are open, I’m curious, do those actually do anything? As I’m sure you’ve heard, STA256 is notorious for being a difficult course. It had a D+ average as compared to C+ for CSC236 (also a difficult course!). \n\nThere’s just way too much content in that course, our “comprehensive” exam did not even include material from the first half of the course and still came out to be a 3 hour exam. Personally, that course was the most hectic course I’ve taken.\n\nFor many students, it’s the first (and last) stats course they will ever take. Way back when Prof Sharmin was a student at UTM, even she found the course difficult, deciding to drop the course and take it at a later time. STA256 has dissuaded plenty from exploring the statistics discipline. It seems like year after year, not much has changed. \n\nI think that’s a big reason as why so few student fill out course evals, 1. It seems like our feedback has little to no effect, and 2. The feedback we provide is for the next offering of the course, not for the current one. One benefit of anonymous feedback is that, it establishes a communication channel for students on the state of the course. The only profs I know who read evaluations are you and Dan, which is really great (not that other profs don’t read them). \n\nMaybe this is the wrong place to send this, but I just wanted your opinion on this. [/quote]\n\nYes, course evaluations have an impact. However, they may not have the impact you want, and different instructors handle them differently.\n\nHow might they have impact? The Chair reviews feedback. It's used as one component of merit pay increases each year, and consistent low evaluations could lead the Chair to put supports in place to try to help train the instructor. Ultimately, this could lead an instructor to not be rehired or for a faculty member on a promotion track to not be promoted. This has more impact on some instructors (new instructors, usually) than others (errr ... me). The department leadership (either a Chair or a curriculum committee) can also use feedback for a course as evidence to call for a program to restructure its curriculum or to update a course.  \n\nWhy hasn't that happened with 256? I don't know. I'm not privy to the feedback received about 256, nor have I evaluated the course in any way. I trust the faculty who often teaches it (Prof. Nosedal-Sanchez) to not ignore feedback, but he may not be able or willing to make the changes you want. \n\nAgain: I don't know anything about STA256, so don't take my comments as reflections of that course. Instead, pretend I'm talking about CSC258, as you might levy similar charges against it: it covers a great deal of material, and students find it difficult. So, why doesn't feedback always have the impact you want? There are a couple decent reasons and a couple bad ones.\n\nFirst, we don't necessarily interpret data the same way that you do. We have a different perspective and goals from you. Students providing evidence that a course is difficult might lead them to conclude that the course needs to be changed. It might lead an instructor to conclude that more supports are needed but that the challenge is warranted or is even desirable.\n\nSecond, we are constrained by the curriculum. While we might agree with some feedback, we cannot (well, [i]should not[/i]) just remove content from a course if that content is required by the course description or program map. If other courses rely on material a course, it has to be there. Similarly, if the program relies on the course to expose students to certain ideas the faculty have decided are important, they have to be there.  The instructor can push for the curriculum to change, but if the department doesn't agree or if it is not a priority, then those changes can be rejected or deferred. In those cases, the course content remains the same until circumstances change. (For example, in 258, I have pushed for digital design to be dropped in favor of more architecture for some time, but there isn't a consensus about which material should be dropped / added, so discussions continue.)\n\nThird, we don't always have time or think it is a high enough priority to make the change. This is the only bad reason, in my opinion, of the three I've presented so far, but sometimes it's not avoidable. I'm guilty of it: I didn't get around to reworking the labs to use something other than Quartus last summer, so the course remained the same for another year. It's a higher priority this year, but 108 and 209 were higher priorities last year, and I have other responsibilities than just teaching.\n\nFourth, some profs just don't care. It happens, and it's frustrating, but it does happen.  \n\nAll that being said: please take feedback seriously. It's important for us when making decisions, and it provides valuable information about how to change the courses we'e working on. I'm glad that you find anonymous feedback to be a useful way to provide feedback to instructors, and I'm very glad that you seem to think that the instructors in CS are reacting to feedback in appropriate ways. \n\nFor me: I know that I don't make as many changes as some students would like (changing course mid-stream is complex, and I don't feel I have enough time in-term to think through major changes), but I want to assure you that even when a comment doesn't directly lead to an immediate change, I seriously consider the comments I receive. In particular, I revisit past terms' feedback -- both from the anonymous feedback mechanism and course evaluations -- before preparing a new version of a course. I suspect other faculty, like Prof. Zingaro, use feedback in a similar manner, so please take it seriously.	142.1.2.212	-1912536364	0	0	15	1522260600	1

It doesn't seem (atleast from my opinion) that the resources we require (mcs servers and...?) validate paying an extra 6k. [/quote]\n\nThe department (and the campus) don't directly get any additional funding from your higher fees. It [i]does[/i] help us make an argument, occasionally, that we should have some service or resource funded, but it's not generally true that we get more money (for hardware, profs, extra TAs, etc.) because you pay higher fees.  \n\n[i]As I understand it[/i] (and I must warn you that I am not an expert), computer science fees are "deregulated" because the government chose to make them so. (The Ontario government deregulated fees for "professional" programs in 1998.) The argument is that CS -- like business, law, engineering, etc. --  is a high-demand degree that is likely to lead to a career, and as a result, you can afford to pay those fees. \n\nThat argument, in my opinion, has some serious flaws. It hinders access to those programs to lower income students (making it difficult for them to leave their income bracket), and it dissuades students from completing programs that have a direct practical application. (Whether that's good or not is debatable; I've already gotten on my soapbox to discuss what the role of the university is ...)  It's also dissonant with the government's recent push to make all higher education "experiential" and to better prepare graduates for career-readiness.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1522630793	1

30360	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1523285849	[quote]Why are there more Academic Offences in courses you teach than other CS courses? I've honestly never heard of as many AOs in CSC236 or csc263 but 108 and 209 are known for busting cheaters. Why don't you just put more weight on Tests and Exams (like the 56% weight on the final and 30% on tests that Dan apparently did in 148) to reduce the amount of "busting" you have to do. This will subsequently firstly, reduce the need to academically offend and secondly, make you (look) less angry all the time and increase the amount of time you spend on other things such as improving CS research at UTM (like srs, right now it is crap compared to STGeorge) and the amount of office hours you have. [/quote]\n\nThere's quite a bit to unpack in this post. Well, beyond the "you look angry" bit -- I think we've established that I have a resting angry face. I'm really [i]not[/i] that grumpy ... I think.\n\nFirst: A funny story. Prof. Zingaro reduced the weight on 148 assignments this year to try to reduce the amount of cheating, but he found it had the opposite effect. Apparently, people decided that since it was worth less, they would spend less time on it, and then they panicked and cheated [i]more[/i].  \n\nSecond: Anyway. I think I (and he) catch more cheaters simply because we look. There's also the issue that I've been teaching programming-heavy courses recently. We don't tend to find cheating in 236-263 because there isn't a history of looking (until recently, the submissions were not digitized and hence, were not easy to search), and we don't find them in 258 because the labs are relatively simple.\n\nThat being said: I'm seeing a troublesome trend. The amount of cheating we're finding has increased faster than the growth in the courses. For 209 ... I have [i]never[/i] caught so many people cheating in second year as this year. Before last year, I had never caught anyone cheating in second or third year. I suspect that's a combination of stress -- a myopic focus on marks -- and ... me. The issue is that once I find blatant cheating, I feel the need to investigate, and that creates momentum: the more you look, the more you find. \n\nThis trend worries me because it is a symptom of a problem in the community. The competition for POSt, relative lack of support on assignments, etc. are combining to create an environment where people feel their best choice is to game the system. Clamping down on cheating isn't the solution -- though it's something we have to do, too. Competition for the POSt is something you know we're working on, but it's difficult for us to control, so we're also working on providing more support, with an open lab / staffed teaching lab. However, we also need some help from you: the senior members of the community (i.e., you) have the ability to set the community norms. You can make cheating an unacceptable option simply by discouraging obvious cheating in the labs. \n\nThird: I take a handful of students on research projects this year. I need to run interviews for ROP in the next couple of weeks, but I'm also happy to work with 492/493 students. If you have an idea, please drop me a line.	142.1.3.71	-1912536249	0	0	15	1523285984	1

[/quote]\n\nIt's a university-level (not a departmental) issue. [url=http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/policy/relations.htm]There is a conflict of interest policy[/url] for professors. The norms, at least in this department, are more strict. I would be appalled if a professor were dating an undergrad. It sometimes happens with grad students, though, and in those cases, the other faculty supervising the student should take care to keep the faculty member from exercising influence.\n\nGrad student-undergraduate relations are fairly common, and peer relationships between grads or undergrads are even more so. I expect there's a similar conflict of interest policy for TAs, but it's more relaxed, since the power differential is smaller. My attitude is that TAs should disclose conflicts of interest with the instructor and recuse themselves from marking the person they have a conflict with. Relationships between TAs and students are not banned, but the goal is to keep someone from having power over someone else.\n\n[quote]Also a suggestion, midterms, test, assignments and/or exams should not have the students names on them rather only the student number as many TAs are also students enrolled  and are peers of ours in other courses and sometimes they may know us personally (as friends before the course started) therefore causing biases in marking as well as the uncomfortable feeling that someone who is my peer knows my marks (I'm more secretive about my marks than about my social security number)....?????\n[/quote]\n\nI'm sorry you're uncomfortable with TAs knowing your name and mark, but they're employees, and your name (or some second piece of identifying info) has to be somewhere on the test. It's just a logistical issue. \n\nWe typically just fold the first page back, so that the name is not visible, then mark each page separately. The TAs won't know who you are until they start writing marks on the front (or unless they look, but they shouldn't look before they mark).	142.1.3.71	-1912536249	0	0	0	0	1

A student in the major can pick and choose courses, which means they can avoid an entire section of the discipline (everything theory related, for example, or anything in systems). However, we require that specialists take courses from across the discipline, so that they're exposed to a wide variety of ideas. I don't know that the required courses are [i]harder[/i] -- some electives, such as CSC463, are among the most difficult of the courses we offer -- but you can't avoid taking courses in areas in which you are weaker if you are in the specialist.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1

I think it's a matter of timing. We try to keep instructors from teaching both 108 and 148 (sorry, Prof. Maccio!) because both courses are a fairly heavy load and because students benefit, especially early on, from having very different instructional experiences. The courses I used to be assigned regularly -- CSC258 and CSC369 -- were both winter term courses a few years ago, so I was free for the fall term (108) but not the winter. Now, with 258 and 209, I remain busier in the winter.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1523326129	1

Why not? [/quote]\n\nI tried an experiment in two courses (108 and 258, fwiw). In one year of each of the courses, I posted solutions. In the other, I didn't. In both cases, marks dropped in the course where I had posted solutions. The sample size is too small to generalize, but it, along with some discussions with the students involved, convinced me that just simply posting solutions was risky enough that I don't do it anymore.  \n\nThat's potentially controversial. There's a strong body of work that supports the idea that worked examples help. A worked example is one where a problem is posed and a solution or set of solutions are presented. While it's not part of the main definition, some studies looking at attributes of worked examples have suggested that good worked examples (a) present not only [i]how[/i] a problem is solved but [i]why[/i] a particular solution works or [i]why[/i] a particular solution approach was chosen and (b) are presented in sequences, with less and less detail provided in each subsequent example ("fading").  \n\nThe problem is, in my opinion, that exam and quiz solutions aren't worked examples. In particular, they aren't presented as part of a sequence, so it makes them susceptible to some known weaknesses: focusing on a single solution and incorrect self-explanations (learner generated explanations as to why particular steps are being taken). This was at least partially corroborated with discussions with students in the courses where solutions were presented. The students provided some evidence that they were focusing on the solutions themselves (from past tests and from problems in the book) and were learning features of the solutions, instead of using the solutions to generate effective explanations about the process being used to solve the problems.\n\nI suspect it's analogous to what we see in machine learning when insufficient numbers of examples in the training data are provided.\n\nThis leads to a potential solution: build sequences of worked examples, using past exams as a source of inspiration, so that students can learn the process. It's a good idea, and I'd like to do it. It'll take more exams than I currently have, though, and I haven't spent the time to do it yet.  \n\nWhat did the students who didn't get solutions do? Some struggled. They had trouble identifying when they had a correct solution, for example. The ones that succeeded used a couple methods: some found solutions online (as if I gave them solutions), some formed study groups (which lead to discussions about problems -- a potential win, in my opinion), and others found multiple ways to solve the problems or found ways to verify their solutions (a definite win).\n\n[b]Edit:[/b] Reading back on that, I could summarize it as, "Andrew spent too much time studying something, then found that being lazy made students do things that he thought were good. He hasn't gathered enough energy yet to build the better solution, so he's sticking with being lazy."	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1523407732	1

Like -- we don't need socket setup code to use select. That suggests that people are using code like boilerplate, without understanding what it is doing, and there's also evidence of that in the short answer questions.	138.51.9.74	-1976366774	0	0	0	0	1

30519	7467	24008	342	RE: Anonymous Feedback Responses	0	15	peters43	1523570703	[quote]I was wondering, since the average for a4 is a bit low, would you ever consider taking the weight of the assignment and distributing part of it somewhere else, possibly exam or the lab, specifically w11 (since it related to a4)? Would you ever consider something like that? This is completely out of curiosity. I understand once the distribution on the syllabus have been set, its difficult to change them.[/quote]\n\nNot after the fact, no. I have, in the past, asked the class if they'd be willing to push some of the weight of a midterm that didn't go well onto the final exam. I wouldn't push the weight to something else that has already been submitted; that would just inflate marks, instead of giving students an incentive to put in more effort.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1523570719	1

Does this difference mean anything to employers ? and are the new requirements (73 in Mat102  and csc148) a step toward having similar requirements to saint george ?[/quote]\n\nFor the second question: That's not our intention, and I hope it's not what occurs. The higher requirements go, the more we're dissuading people from trying and the more stress we're putting on the population. We added some flexibility on course marks to try to release a little bit of pressure on CGPA and to dissuade students from taking a year off to study <insert your favorite bird subject> to raise their GPA.\n\nFor the first question: It's mostly a matter of demand. StG is perceived to be more prestigious, and downtown is better known internationally. They get far more applicants per seat in the POSt than we do.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	15	1523570979	1

What questions are asked in these interviews because I forgot most of the assignment that was 3 weeks back and don't have much time to go through it in the middle of other exams.[/quote]\n\nIf the interview is with me (for 209), then don't bother to review your code. I won't be asking about it. I will show you the evidence that sparked the investigation and ask you to provide an explanation as to why the two submissions could be similar. They could, for example, both be based on code from lecture or from an online source that you referenced appropriately.	184.146.24.43	-1198385109	0	0	0	0	1
